title : C_D015738-associated D_D003693 . 
A series of six cases . 
abstract : C_D015738 is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist used in inpatient settings for prevention of stress D_D014456 and is showing increasing popularity because of its low cost . 
Although all of the currently available H2-receptor antagonists have shown the propensity to cause D_D003693 , only two previously reported cases have been associated with C_D015738 . 
The authors report on six cases of C_D015738-associated D_D003693 in hospitalized patients who cleared completely upon removal of C_D015738 . 
The pharmacokinetics of C_D015738 are reviewed , with no change in its metabolism in the elderly population seen . 
The implications of using C_D015738 in elderly persons are discussed .

title : C_D007213 induced D_D007022 in C_D012964 and volume depleted rats . 
abstract : After a single oral dose of 4 mg/kg C_D007213 ( C_D007213 ) to C_D012964 and volume depleted rats plasma renin activity ( PRA ) and systolic blood pressure fell significantly within four hours . 
In C_D012964 repleted animals C_D007213 did not change systolic blood pressure ( BP ) although plasma renin activity was decreased . 
Thus , C_D007213 by inhibition of C_D011453 synthesis may diminish the blood pressure maintaining effect of the stimulated renin-C_D000809 system in C_D012964 and volume depletion .

title : The risk and associated factors of C_D008694 D_D011605 in C_D008694-dependent patients in Malaysia . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to determine the risk of lifetime and current C_D008694-induced D_D011605 in patients with C_D008694 dependence . 
The association between psychiatric co-morbidity and C_D008694-induced D_D011605 was also studied . 
METHODS : This was a cross-sectional study conducted concurrently at a teaching hospital and a drug rehabilitation center in Malaysia . 
Patients with the diagnosis of C_D008694 based on DSM-IV were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( M.I.N.I . ) 
for C_D008694-induced D_D011605 and other Axis I D_D001523 . 
The information on sociodemographic background and drug use history was obtained from interview or medical records . 
RESULTS : Of 292 subjects , 47.9 % of the subjects had a past history of D_D011605 and 13.0 % of the patients were having current D_D011605 . 
Co-morbid major D_D003866 ( OR=7.18 , 95 CI=2.612-19.708 ) , D_D001714 ( OR=13.807 , 95 CI=5.194-36.706 ) , D_D000987 ( OR=12.619 , 95 CI=6.702-23.759 ) and heavy C_D008694 uses were significantly associated with lifetime C_D008694-induced D_D011605 after adjusted for other factors . 
Major D_D003866 ( OR=2.870 , CI=1.154-7.142 ) and D_D000987 ( OR=3.299 , 95 CI=1.375-7.914 ) were the only factors associated with current D_D011605 . 
CONCLUSION : There was a high risk of D_D011605 in patients with C_D008694 dependence . 
It was associated with co-morbid D_D019964 , D_D000987 , and heavy C_D008694 use . 
It is recommended that all cases of C_D008694 dependence should be screened for D_D011605 .

title : Cerebellar sensory processing alterations impact motor cortical plasticity in D_D010300 : clues from D_D004409 patients . 
abstract : The plasticity of primary motor cortex ( M1 ) in patients with D_D010300 ( D_D010300 ) and C_D007980-induced D_D004409 ( D_D004409 ) is severely impaired . 
We recently reported in young healthy subjects that inhibitory cerebellar stimulation enhanced the sensorimotor plasticity of M1 that was induced by paired associative stimulation ( PAS ) . 
This study demonstrates that the deficient sensorimotor M1 plasticity in 16 patients with D_D004409 could be reinstated by a single session of real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation but not sham stimulation . 
This was evident only when a sensory component was involved in the induction of plasticity , indicating that cerebellar sensory processing function is involved in the resurgence of M1 plasticity . 
The benefit of inhibitory cerebellar stimulation on D_D004409 is known . 
To explore whether this benefit is linked to the restoration of sensorimotor plasticity of M1 , we conducted an additional study looking at changes in D_D004409 and PAS-induced plasticity after 10 sessions of either bilateral , real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation or sham stimulation . 
Only real and not sham stimulation had an antiD_D004409 effect and it was paralleled by a resurgence in the sensorimotor plasticity of M1 . 
These results suggest that alterations in cerebellar sensory processing function , occurring secondary to abnormal basal ganglia signals reaching it , may be an important element contributing to the maladaptive sensorimotor plasticity of M1 and the emergence of D_D004409 .

title : The function of P2X3 receptor and NK1 receptor antagonists on C_D003520-induced D_D003556 in rats . 
abstract : PURPOSE : The purpose of the study is to explore the function of P2X3 and NK1 receptors antagonists on C_D003520 ( C_D003520 ) -induced D_D003556 in rats . 
METHODS : Sixty female Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rats were randomly divided into three groups . 
The rats in the control group were intraperitoneally ( i.p . ) 
injected with 0.9 % saline ( 4 ml/kg ) ; the rats in the model group were i.p . 
injected with C_D003520 ( 150 mg/kg ) ; and the rats in the intervention group were i.p . 
injected with C_D003520 with subsequently perfusion of bladder with P2X3 and NK1 receptors ' antagonists , C_D013498 and C_C079014 . 
Spontaneous D_D010146 behaviors following the administration of C_D003520 were observed . 
Urodynamic parameters , bladder pressure-volume curve , maximum voiding pressure ( MVP ) , and maximum cystometric capacity ( MCC ) , were recorded . 
Pathological changes in bladder tissue were observed . 
Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of P2X3 and NK1 receptors in bladder . 
RESULTS : C_D003520 treatment increased the spontaneous D_D010146 behaviors scores . 
The incidence of bladder instability during urine storage period of model group was significantly higher than intervention group ( X ( 2 ) = 7.619 , P = 0.007 ) and control group ( X ( 2 ) = 13.755 , P = 0.000 ) . 
MCC in the model group was lower than the control and intervention groups ( P < 0.01 ) . 
Histological changes evident in model and intervention groups rats ' bladder included D_D004487 , vasodilation , and infiltration of inflammatory cells . 
In model group , the expression of P2X3 receptor increased in urothelium and suburothelium , and NK1 receptor increased in suburothelium , while the expression of them in intervention group was lower . 
CONCLUSIONS : In C_D003520-induced D_D003556 , the expression of P2X3 and NK1 receptors increased in urothelium and/or suburothelium . 
Perfusion of bladder with P2X3 and NK1 receptors antagonists ameliorated the bladder function .

title : Acute D_D056486 associated with C_C055162 : a case report and review of the literature . 
abstract : Drug-induced D_D056486 is a common cause of acute D_D056486 , and the recognition of the responsible drug may be difficult . 
We describe a case of C_C055162-related acute D_D056486 . 
The diagnosis is strongly suggested by an accurate medical history and liver biopsy . 
Reports about cases of D_D056486 due to C_C055162 are increasing in the last few years , after the increased use of this drug . 
In conclusion , we believe that physicians should carefully consider the risk of drug-induced D_D056486 when C_C055162 is prescribed .

title : C_C400082 and C_D003907 as salvage therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory D_D009101 : analysis of long-term clinical outcomes . 
abstract : C_C400082 ( C_C400082 ) -C_D003907 ( C_D003907 ) is an effective therapy for relapsed/refractory ( R/R ) D_D009101 ( D_D009101 ) . 
This retrospective study investigated the combination of C_C400082 ( 1.3 mg/m ( 2 ) on days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 every 3 weeks ) and C_D003907 ( 20 mg on the day of and the day after C_C400082 ) as salvage treatment in 85 patients with R/R D_D009101 after prior autologous stem cell transplantation or conventional chemotherapy . 
The median number of prior lines of therapy was 2 . 
Eighty-seven percent of the patients had received immunomodulatory drugs included in some line of therapy before C_C400082-C_D003907 . 
The median number of C_C400082-C_D003907 cycles was 6 , up to a maximum of 12 cycles . 
On an intention-to-treat basis , 55 % of the patients achieved at least partial response , including 19 % CR and 35 % achieved at least very good partial response . 
Median durations of response , time to next therapy and treatment-free interval were 8 , 11.2 , and 5.1 months , respectively . 
The most relevant adverse event was D_D010523 , which occurred in 78 % of the patients ( grade II , 38 % ; grade III , 21 % ) and led to treatment discontinuation in 6 % . 
With a median follow up of 22 months , median time to progression , progression-free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) were 8.9 , 8.7 , and 22 months , respectively . 
Prolonged PFS and OS were observed in patients achieving CR and receiving C_C400082-C_D003907 a single line of prior therapy . 
C_C400082-C_D003907 was an effective salvage treatment for D_D009101 patients , particularly for those in first relapse .

title : Pubertal exposure to C_C006780 increases D_D001008-like behavior and decreases acetylcholinesterase activity of hippocampus in adult male mice . 
abstract : The negative effects of C_C006780 ( C_C006780 ) on neurodevelopment and behaviors have been well established . 
Acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) is a regulatory enzyme which is involved in D_D001008-like behavior . 
This study investigated behavioral phenotypes and AChE activity in male mice following C_C006780 exposure during puberty . 
On postnatal day ( PND ) 35 , male mice were exposed to 50mg C_C006780/kg diet per day for a period of 35 days . 
On PND71 , a behavioral assay was performed using the elevated plus maze ( EPM ) and the light/dark test . 
In addition , AChE activity was measured in the prefrontal cortex , hypothalamus , cerebellum and hippocampus . 
Results from our behavioral phenotyping indicated that D_D001008-like behavior was increased in mice exposed to C_C006780 . 
AChE activity was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of mice with C_C006780 compared to control mice , whereas no difference was found in the prefrontal cortex , hypothalamus and cerebellum . 
Our findings showed that pubertal C_C006780 exposure increased D_D001008-like behavior , which may be associated with decreased AChE activity of the hippocampus in adult male mice . 
Further studies are necessary to investigate the cholinergic signaling of the hippocampus in PBE induced D_D001008-like behaviors .

title : Biochemical effects of Solidago virgaurea extract on experimental D_D066126 . 
abstract : D_D002318 ( D_D002318 ) are the major health problem of advanced as well as developing countries of the world . 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of the Solidago virgaurea extract on C_D007545-induced D_D066126 in rats . 
The subcutaneous injection of C_D007545 ( 30 mg/kg ) into rats twice at an interval of 24 h , for two consecutive days , led to a significant increase in serum C_D019344 dehydrogenase , C_D003401 phosphokinase , C_D000409 transaminase , C_D001224 transaminase , and C_D000809-converting enzyme activities , total C_D002784 , C_D014280 , free serum C_D005227 , cardiac tissue C_D008315 ( C_D008315 ) , and C_D009569 levels and a significant decrease in levels of C_D005978 and C_D013481 dismutase in cardiac tissue as compared to the normal control group ( P < 0.05 ) . 
Pretreatment with S. virgaurea extract for 5 weeks at a dose of 250 mg/kg followed by C_D007545 injection significantly prevented the observed alterations . 
C_D002216 ( 50 mg/kg/day , given orally ) , an inhibitor of C_D000809-converting enzyme used as a standard cardioprotective drug , was used as a positive control in this study . 
The data of the present study suggest that S. virgaurea extract exerts its protective effect by decreasing C_D008315 level and increasing the antioxidant status in C_D007545-treated rats . 
The study emphasizes the beneficial action of S. virgaurea extract as a cardioprotective agent .

title : '' Real-world '' data on the efficacy and safety of C_C467567 and C_D003907 in patients with relapsed/refractory D_D009101 who were treated according to the standard clinical practice : a study of the Greek D_D009101 Study Group . 
abstract : C_C467567 and C_D003907 ( C_C467567|D003907 ) is a standard of care for relapsed/refractory D_D009101 ( D_D009101 ) , but there is limited published data on its efficacy and safety in the `` real world '' ( RW ) , according to the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research definition . 
We studied 212 D_D009101 patients who received C_C467567|D003907 in RW . 
Objective response ( > PR ( partial response ) ) rate was 77.4 % ( complete response ( CR ) , 20.2 % ) . 
Median time to first and best response was 2 and 5 months , respectively . 
Median time to CR when C_C467567|D003907 was given as 2nd or > 2 ( nd ) -line treatment at 4 and 11 months , respectively . 
Quality of response was independent of previous lines of therapies or previous exposure to C_D013792 or C_C400082 . 
Median duration of response was 34.4 months , and it was higher in patients who received C_C467567|D003907 until progression ( not reached versus 19 months , p < 0.001 ) . 
Improvement of humoral immunity occurred in 60 % of responders ( p < 0.001 ) and in the majority of patients who achieved stable disease . 
Adverse events were reported in 68.9 % of patients ( D_D001855 in 49.4 % ) and 12.7 % of patients needed hospitalization . 
D_D010523 was observed only in 2.5 % of patients and D_D020246 in 5.7 % . 
Dose reductions were needed in 31 % of patients and permanent discontinuation in 38.9 % . 
Median time to treatment discontinuation was 16.8 months . 
Performance status ( PS ) and initial C_C467567 dose predicted for treatment discontinuation . 
Extra-medullary relapses occurred in 3.8 % of patients . 
Our study confirms that C_C467567|D003907 is effective and safe in D_D009101 in the RW ; it produces durable responses especially in patients who continue on treatment till progression and improves humoral immunity even in patients with stable disease .

title : The cytogenetic action of C_D007069 , C_D015080 , and their combination on peripheral rabbit lymphocytes : an in vivo/in vitro cytogenetic study . 
abstract : C_D007069 ( C_D007069 ) is an alkylating C_D009584 mustard , administrated as an antineoplasmic agent . 
It is characterized by its intense urotoxic action , leading to hemorrhagic cystitis . 
This side effect of C_D007069 raises the requirement for the co-administration with C_D015080 ( C_D015080 ) aiming to avoid or minimize this effect . 
C_D007069 and C_D015080 were administrated separately on rabbit 's lymphocytes in vivo , which were later developed in vitro . 
Cytogenetic markers for sister chromatid exchanges ( SCEs ) , proliferation rate index ( PRI ) and Mitotic Index were recorded . 
C_D015080 's action , in conjunction with C_D007069 reduces the frequency of SCEs , in comparison with the SCEs recordings obtained when C_D007069 is administered alone . 
In addition to this , when high concentrations of C_D015080 were administered alone significant reductions of the PRI were noted , than with C_D007069 acting at the same concentration on the lymphocytes . 
C_D015080 significantly reduces C_D007069 's D_D030342 , while when administered in high concentrations it acts in an inhibitory fashion on the cytostatic action of the drug .

title : Risk factors and predictors of C_D007980-induced D_D004409 among multiethnic Malaysians with D_D010300 . 
abstract : Chronic pulsatile C_D007980 therapy for D_D010300 ( D_D010300 ) leads to the development of motor fluctuations and D_D004409 . 
We studied the prevalence and predictors of C_D007980-induced D_D004409 among multiethnic Malaysian patients with D_D010300 . 
METHODS : This is a cross-sectional study involving 95 patients with D_D010300 on uninterrupted C_D007980 therapy for at least 6 months . 
The instrument used was the UD_D010300RS questionnaires . 
The predictors of D_D004409 were determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis . 
RESULTS : The mean age was 65.6 + 8.5 years . 
The mean onset age was 58.5 + 9.8 years . 
The median disease duration was 6 ( 7 ) years . 
D_D004409 was present in 44 % ( n = 42 ) with median C_D007980 therapy of 3 years . 
There were 64.3 % Chinese , 31 % Malays , and 3.7 % Indians and other ethnic groups . 
Eighty-one percent of patients with D_D004409 had clinical fluctuations . 
Patients with D_D004409 had lower onset age ( p < 0.001 ) , longer duration of C_D007980 therapy ( p < 0.001 ) , longer disease duration ( p < 0.001 ) , higher total daily C_D007980 dose ( p < 0.001 ) , and higher total UD_D010300RS scores ( p = 0.005 ) than patients without D_D004409 . 
The three significant predictors of D_D004409 were duration of C_D007980 therapy , onset age , and total daily C_D007980 dose . 
CONCLUSIONS : The prevalence of C_D007980-induced D_D004409 in our patients was 44 % . 
The most significant predictors were duration of C_D007980 therapy , total daily C_D007980 dose , and onset age .

abstract : D_D011507 is an expected complication in transplant patients treated with mammalian target of C_D020123 inhibitors ( mTOR-i ) . 
However , clinical suspicion should always be supported by histological evidence in order to investigate potential alternate diagnoses such as acute or chronic rejection , interstitial D_D005355 and tubular D_D001284 , or recurrent or de novo D_D007674 . 
In this case we report the unexpected diagnosis of D_D000686 in a renal-transplant patient with pre-transplant monoclonal gammapathy of undetermined significance who developed D_D011507 after conversion from C_D016559 to C_C107135 .

title : An investigation of the pattern of D_D007674 in HIV-positive persons exposed to C_C418563 : an examination of a large population database ( MHRA database ) . 
abstract : The potential for C_C096918 to cause a range of kidney syndromes has been established from mechanistic and randomised clinical trials . 
However , the exact pattern of kidney involvement is still uncertain . 
We undertook a descriptive analysis of Yellow Card records of 407 HIV-positive persons taking C_C418563 ( C_C418563 ) as part of their antiretroviral therapy regimen and submitted to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) with suspected kidney adverse effects . 
Reports that satisfy defined criteria were classified as acute D_D007674 , D_D007674 and D_D005198 . 
Of the 407 Yellow Card records analysed , 106 satisfied criteria for C_C418563-related D_D007674 , of which 53 ( 50 % ) had features of D_D007674 , 35 ( 33 % ) were found to have features of D_D007674 and 18 ( 17 % ) had D_D005198 . 
The median C_C418563 exposure was 316 days ( interquartile range 120-740 ) . 
The incidence of hospitalisation for C_C418563 kidney adverse effects was high , particularly amongst patients with features of D_D005198 . 
The pattern of kidney syndromes in this population series mirrors that reported in randomised clinical trials . 
Cessation of C_C418563 was associated with complete restoration of kidney function in up half of the patients in this report .

title : Incidence of D_D011183 is high even in a population without known risk factors . 
abstract : PURPOSE : D_D011183 is a recognized complication in populations at risk . 
The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of early D_D011183 in a population without known risk factors admitted to the ICU for postoperative monitoring after elective major surgery . 
The secondary outcome investigated is to identify eventual independent risk factors among demographic data and anesthetic drugs used . 
METHODS : An observational , prospective study was conducted on a consecutive cohort of patients admitted to our ICU within and for at least 24 h after major surgical procedures . 
Exclusion criteria were any preexisting predisposing factor for D_D003693 or other potentially confounding D_D009422 . 
Patients were assessed daily using the D_D003221 assessment method for the ICU scale for 3 days after the surgical procedure . 
Early D_D011183 incidence risk factors were then assessed through three different multiple regression models . 
RESULTS : According to the D_D003221 assessment method for the ICU scale , 28 % of patients were diagnosed with early D_D011183 . 
The use of C_D013874 was significantly associated with an eight-fold-higher risk for D_D003693 compared to C_D015742 ( 57.1 % vs. 7.1 % , RR = 8.0 , X2 = 4.256 ; df = 1 ; 0.05 < p < 0.02 ) . 
CONCLUSION : In this study early D_D011183 was found to be a very common complication after major surgery , even in a population without known risk factors . 
C_D013874 was independently associated with an increase in its relative risk .

abstract : C_D008694 ( C_D008694 ) triggers a disruption of the monoaminergic system and C_D008694 abuse leads to negative emotional states including D_D003866 symptoms during drug withdrawal . 
However , it is currently unknown if the acute toxic dosage of C_D008694 also causes a long-lasting D_D003866 phenotype and persistent monoaminergic deficits . 
Thus , we now assessed the D_D003866-like behaviour in mice at early and long-term periods following a single high C_D008694 dose ( 30 mg/kg , i.p . ) . 
C_D008694 did not alter the motor function and procedural memory of mice as assessed by swimming speed and escape latency to find the platform in a cued version of the water maze task . 
However , C_D008694 significantly increased the immobility time in the tail suspension test at 3 and 49 days post-administration . 
This D_D003866-like profile induced by C_D008694 was accompanied by a marked depletion of frontostriatal C_D004298rgic and serotonergic neurotransmission , indicated by a reduction in the levels of C_D004298 , C_D015102 and C_D006719 , C_D014443 hydroxylase and C_D012701 , observed at both 3 and 49 days post-administration . 
In parallel , another neurochemical feature of D_D003866 -- astroglial dysfunction -- was unaffected in the cortex and the striatal levels of the astrocytic protein marker , glial fibrillary acidic protein , were only transiently increased at 3 days . 
These findings demonstrate for the first time that a single high dose of C_D008694 induces long-lasting D_D003866-like behaviour in mice associated with a persistent disruption of frontostriatal C_D004298rgic and serotonergic homoeostasis .

title : C_C098010-induced D_D009901 . 
abstract : Many systemic antimicrobials have been implicated to cause ocular adverse effects . 
This is especially relevant in multidrug therapy where more than one drug can cause a similar ocular adverse effect . 
We describe a case of progressive D_D014786 associated with C_C098010 therapy . 
A 45-year-old male patient who was on treatment with multiple second-line anti-tuberculous drugs including C_C098010 and C_D004977 for D_D054908 ( D_D054908 ) presented to us with painless progressive D_D014786 in both eyes . 
Color vision was defective and fundus examination revealed D_C531767 in both eyes . 
C_D004977-induced toxic D_D009901 was suspected and tablet C_D004977 was withdrawn . 
D_D015354 occurred despite withdrawal of C_D004977 . 
Discontinuation of C_C098010 resulted in marked improvement of vision . 
Our report emphasizes the need for monitoring of visual function in patients on long-term C_C098010 treatment .

title : Resuscitation with lipid , C_D004837 , or both in C_C476513-induced D_D066126 in newborn piglets . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : The optimal dosing regimens of lipid emulsion , C_D004837 , or both are not yet determined in neonates in cases of local anaesthetic systemic D_D064420 ( LAST ) . 
METHODS : Newborn piglets received C_C476513 until D_D002318 occurred . 
Standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started and electrocardiogram ( ECG ) was monitored for D_D017180 , D_D001281 , or QRS prolongation . 
Piglets were then randomly allocated to four groups : control ( saline ) , Intralipid ( ) alone , C_D004837 alone , or a combination of Intralipd plus C_D004837 . 
Resuscitation continued for 30 min or until there was a return of spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) accompanied by a mean arterial pressure at or superior to the baseline pressure and normal sinus rhythm for a period of 30 min . 
RESULTS : ROSC was achieved in only one of the control piglets compared with most of the treated piglets . 
Mortality was not significantly different between the three treatment groups , but was significantly lower in all the treatment groups compared with control . 
The number of ECG abnormalities was zero in the Intralipid only group , but 14 and 17 , respectively , in the C_D004837 and C_D004837 plus lipid groups ( P < 0.05 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : Lipid emulsion with or without C_D004837 , or C_D004837 alone were equally effective in achieving a return to spontaneous circulation in this model of LAST . 
C_D004837 alone or in combination with lipid was associated with an increased number of ECG abnormalities compared with lipid emulsion alone .

title : Incidence of C_D006493-induced D_D013921 and postoperative recovery of platelet count in liver graft recipients : a retrospective cohort analysis . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : D_D013921 in patients with D_D058625 is a common disorder caused mainly by D_D006975 , low levels of thrombopoetin , and D_D019446 . 
The impact of immune-mediated C_D006493-induced D_D013921 ( D_D013921 ) as a cause of D_D013921 after liver transplantation is not yet understood , with few literature citations reporting contradictory results . 
The aim of our study was to demonstrate the perioperative course of D_D013921 after liver transplantation and determine the occurrence of clinical D_D013921 . 
METHOD : We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 205 consecutive adult patients who underwent full-size liver transplantation between January 2006 and December 2010 due to end-stage or malignant liver disease . 
Preoperative platelet count , postoperative course of platelets , and clinical signs of D_D013921 were analyzed . 
RESULTS : A total of 155 ( 75.6 % ) of 205 patients had D_D013921 before transplantation , significantly influenced by Model of D_D058625 score and D_D008103 . 
The platelet count exceeded 100,000/uL in most of the patients ( n = 193 ) at a medium of 7 d. Regarding D_D013921 , there were four ( 1.95 % ) patients with a background of D_D013921 . 
CONCLUSIONS : The incidence of D_D013921 in patients with D_D058625 is , with about 1.95 % , rare . 
For further reduction of D_D013921 , the use of intravenous C_D006493 should be avoided and the prophylactic anticoagulation should be performed with low-molecular-weight C_D006493 after normalization of platelet count .

title : D_D054549 ( or D_D054549 ) secondary to C_C089750 . 
abstract : D_D054549 ( D_D054549 ) , also known as D_D054549 , is characterized by left ventricle apical ballooning with elevated cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of an D_D054058 ( ie , ST-segment elevation , T wave inversions , and pathologic Q waves ) . 
We report a case of 54-year-old woman with medical history of D_D008945 and D_D008881 , who was admitted to the hospital for substernal D_D002637 and electrocardiogram demonstrated 1/2 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II , III , aVF , V5 , and V6 and positive troponin I. Emergent coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with wall motion abnormalities consistent with D_D054549 . 
Detailed history obtained retrospectively revealed that the patient took C_C089750 sparingly only when she had D_D008881 . 
But before this event , she was taking C_C089750 2-3 times daily for several days because of a persistent D_D008881 . 
She otherwise reported that she is quite active , rides horses , and does show jumping without any limitations in her physical activity . 
There was no evidence of any recent stress or D_D008881 . 
Extensive literature search revealed multiple cases of D_D003329 secondary to C_C089750 , but none of the cases were associated with D_D054549 .

title : D_D003866 , D_D010554 , sleep , and memory in past and present polydrug users of C_D018817 ( C_D018817 , C_D018817 ) . 
abstract : RATIONALE : C_D018817 ( C_D018817 , C_D018817 ) is a worldwide recreational drug of abuse . 
Unfortunately , the results from human research investigating its psychological effects have been inconsistent . 
OBJECTIVES : The present study aimed to be the largest to date in sample size and 5HT-related behaviors ; the first to compare present C_D018817 users with past users after an abstinence of 4 or more years , and the first to include robust controls for other recreational substances . 
METHODS : A sample of 997 participants ( 52 % male ) was recruited to four control groups ( non-drug ( ND ) , C_D000431/C_D009538 ( C_D000431|D009538 ) , C_D002188/C_D000431/C_D009538 ( CC_D000431|D009538 ) , non-C_D018817 polydrug ( PD ) ) , and two C_D018817 polydrug groups ( present ( C_D018817 ) and past users ( EX-C_D018817 ) . 
Participants completed a drug history questionnaire , Beck D_D003866 Inventory , Barratt D_D010554 Scale , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised which , in total , provided 13 psychometric measures . 
RESULTS : While the CC_D000431|D009538 and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non-drug controls , the C_D018817 and EX-C_D018817 groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures . 
Strikingly , despite prolonged abstinence ( mean , 4.98 ; range , 4-9 years ) , past C_D018817 users showed few signs of recovery . 
Compared with present C_D018817 users , the past users showed no change for ten measures , increased impairment for two measures , and improvement on just one measure . 
CONCLUSIONS : Given this record of D_D008569 and clinically significant levels of D_D003866 , D_D010554 , and D_D020920 , the prognosis for the current generation of C_D018817 users is a major cause for concern .

title : Association of common genetic variants of HOMER1 gene with C_D007980 adverse effects in D_D010300 patients . 
abstract : C_D007980 is the most effective symptomatic therapy for D_D010300 , but its chronic use could lead to chronic adverse outcomes , such as motor fluctuations , D_D004409 and D_D006212 . 
HOMER1 is a protein with pivotal function in C_D018698 transmission , which has been related to the pathogenesis of these complications . 
This study investigates whether polymorphisms in the HOMER1 gene promoter region are associated with the occurrence of the chronic complications of C_D007980 therapy . 
A total of 205 patients with idiopathic D_D010300 were investigated . 
Patients were genotyped for rs4704559 , rs10942891 and rs4704560 by allelic discrimination with Taqman assays . 
The rs4704559 G allele was associated with a lower prevalence of D_D004409 ( prevalence ratio ( PR ) =0.615 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.426-0.887 , P=0.009 ) and D_D006212 ( PR=0.515 , 95 % CI 0.295-0.899 , P=0.020 ) . 
Our data suggest that HOMER1 rs4704559 G allele has a protective role for the development of C_D007980 adverse effects .

title : C_C029036 improves lipid dysregulation in subacute C_D003976 exposure through ERK1/2 pathway in rat liver . 
abstract : INTRODUCTION : C_D003976 Yis one of the most broadly used C_D010755 insecticides in agriculture . 
It has been shown that exposure to C_D003976 may interfere with lipid metabolism . 
Moreover , the hypolipidemic effect of C_C029036 has been established . 
Earlier studies revealed the major role of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) pathways in low-density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLr ) expression . 
The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the regulation of lipid metabolism , ERK and LDLr expression in the liver of rats exposed to subacute C_D003976 . 
Furthermore ameliorating effect of C_C029036 on C_D003976 induced disturbed C_D002784 homeostasis was studied . 
METHODS : 24 Rats were divided into 4 groups and received following treatments for 4 weeks ; Corn oil ( control ) , C_D003976 ( 15mg/kg per day , orally ) and C_C029036 ( 12.5 and 25mg/kg per day , intraperitoneally ) in combination with C_D003976 ( 15 mg/kg ) . 
The levels of C_D002784 , C_D014280 and LDL in blood of rats were analyzed . 
Moreover mRNA levels of LDLr and ERK1/2 as well as protein levels of total and activated forms of ERK1/2 in rat liver were evaluated by Western blotting and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis . 
RESULTS : Our data showed that subacute exposure to C_D003976 significantly increased concentrations of C_D002784 , C_D014280 and LDL . 
Moreover C_D003976 decreased ERK1/2 protein phosphorylation and LDLr transcript . 
C_C029036 reduced inhibition of ERK activation and C_D003976-induced D_D006949 and increased levels of LDLr transcript . 
CONCLUSIONS : C_C029036 may be considered as a novel protective agent in C_D003976-induced D_D006949 through modulating of ERK pathway and increase of LDLr expression .

title : C_C056507-P chemotherapy is active in the treatment of relapsed D_D006689 . 
abstract : D_D006689 ( D_D006689 ) is a relatively chemosensitive D_D009369 . 
However , for those who relapse , high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant is the treatment of choice which relies on adequate disease control with salvage chemotherapy . 
Regimens commonly used often require inpatient administration and can be difficult to deliver due to D_D064420 . 
C_C056507 and C_D002945 have activity in D_D006689 , non-overlapping D_D064420 with first-line chemotherapeutics , and may be delivered in an outpatient setting . 
In this retrospective single-centre analysis , patients with relapsed or refractory D_D006689 treated with C_C056507 1,000 mg/m ( 2 ) day ( D ) 1 , D8 and D15 ; C_D008775 1,000 mg D1-5 ; and C_D002945 100 mg/m ( 2 ) D15 , every 28 days ( C_C056507-P ) were included . 
Demographic , survival , response and D_D064420 data were recorded . 
Forty-one eligible patients were identified : median age 27 . 
One hundred and twenty-two cycles of C_C056507-P were administered in total ( median 3 cycles ; range 1-6 ) . 
Twenty of 41 ( 48 % ) patients received C_C056507-P as second-line treatment and 11/41 ( 27 % ) as third-line therapy . 
Overall response rate ( ORR ) to C_C056507-P in the entire cohort was 80 % ( complete response ( CR ) 37 % , partial response 44 % ) with 14/15 CR confirmed as a metabolic CR on PET and ORR of 85 % in the 20 second-line patients . 
The most common grade 3/4 D_D064420 were haematological : D_D009503 54 % and D_D013921 51 % . 
Median follow-up from the start of C_C056507-P was 4.5 years . 
Following C_C056507-P , 5-year progression-free survival was 46 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 30-62 % ) and 5-year overall survival was 59 % ( 95 % CI , 43-74 % ) . 
Fourteen of 41 patients proceeded directly to autologous transplant . 
C_C056507-P is a salvage chemotherapy with relatively high response rates , leading to successful transplantation in appropriate patients , in the treatment of relapsed or refractory D_D006689 .

title : Basal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis and psychological distress in recreational C_D018817 polydrug users . 
abstract : RATIONALE : C_D018817 ( C_D018817 ) is a psychostimulant drug which is increasingly associated with D_D008107 . 
While some recent studies suggest acute changes in neuroendocrine function , less is known about long-term changes in HPA functionality in recreational users . 
OBJECTIVES : The current study is the first to explore the effects of C_D018817-polydrug use on psychological distress and basal functioning of the HPA axis through assessing the secretion of C_D006854 across the diurnal period . 
METHOD : Seventy-six participants ( 21 nonusers , 29 light C_D018817-polydrug users , 26 heavy C_D018817-polydrug users ) completed a substance use inventory and measures of psychological distress at baseline , then two consecutive days of C_D006854 sampling ( on awakening , 30 min post awakening , between 1400 and 1600 hours and pre bedtime ) . 
On day 2 , participants also attended the laboratory to complete a 20-min multitasking stressor . 
RESULTS : Both user groups exhibited significantly greater levels of D_D001008 and D_D003866 than nonusers . 
On day 1 , all participants exhibited a typical C_D006854 profile , though light users had significantly elevated levels pre-bed . 
On day 2 , heavy users demonstrated elevated levels upon awakening and all C_D018817-polydrug users demonstrated elevated pre-bed levels compared to non-users . 
Significant between group differences were also observed in afternoon C_D006854 levels and in overall C_D006854 secretion across the day . 
CONCLUSIONS : The increases in D_D001008 and D_D003866 are in line with previous observations in recreational C_D018817-polydrug users . 
Dysregulated diurnal C_D006854 may be indicative of inappropriate anticipation of forthcoming demands and hypersecretion may lead to the increased psychological and physical morbidity associated with heavy recreational use of C_D018817 .

title : C_D007069 related D_D001927 : the need for a timely EEG evaluation . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : C_D007069 is an alkylating agent useful in the treatment of a wide range of D_D009369 including D_D012509 , D_D008223 , gynecologic and testicular D_D009369 . 
D_D001927 has been reported in 10-40 % of patients receiving high-dose IV C_D007069 . 
OBJECTIVE : To highlight the role of electroencephalogram ( EEG ) in the early detection and management of C_D007069 related D_D001927 . 
METHODS : Retrospective chart review including clinical data and EEG recordings was done on five patients , admitted to MD Anderson D_D009369 Center between years 2009 and 2012 , who developed C_D007069 related acute D_D001927 . 
RESULTS : All five patients experienced symptoms of D_D001927 soon after ( within 12 h-2 days ) receiving C_D007069 . 
Two patients developed generalized D_D012640 while one patient developed continuous D_D013226 ( D_D013226 ) that required ICU admission and intubation . 
Initial EEG showed epileptiform discharges in three patients ; run of triphasic waves in one patient and moderate degree diffuse generalized slowing . 
Mixed pattern with the presence of both sharps and triphasic waves were also noted . 
Repeat EEGs within 24_h of symptom onset showed marked improvement that was correlated with clinical improvement . 
CONCLUSIONS : Severity of C_D007069 related D_D001927 correlates with EEG changes . 
We suggest a timely EEG evaluation for patients receiving C_D007069 who develop features of D_D001927 .

title : Incidence of C_D003287-induced D_D007674 in hospitalised patients with D_D009369 . 
abstract : OBJECTIVES : To determine the frequency of and possible factors related to C_D003287-induced D_D007674 ( CIN ) in hospitalised patients with D_D009369 . 
METHODS : Ninety adult patients were enrolled . 
Patients with risk factors for D_D058186 were excluded . 
Blood samples were examined the day before C_D003287-enhanced computed tomography ( CT ) and serially for 3 days thereafter . 
CIN was defined as an increase in serum C_D003404 ( C_D002857 ) of 0.5 mg/dl or more , or elevation of C_D002857 to 25 % over baseline . 
Relationships between CIN and possible risk factors were investigated . 
RESULTS : CIN was detected in 18/90 ( 20 % ) patients . 
CIN developed in 25.5 % patients who underwent chemotherapy and in 11 % patients who did not ( P = 0.1 ) . 
CIN more frequently developed in patients who had undergone CT within 45 days after the last chemotherapy ( P = 0.005 ) ; it was also an independent risk factor ( P = 0.017 ) . 
CIN was significantly more after treatment with C_-1/C_C051890 ( P = 0.021 ) and in patients with D_D006973 ( P = 0.044 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : The incidence of CIN after CT in hospitalised oncological patients was 20 % . 
CIN developed 4.5-times more frequently in patients with D_D009369 who had undergone recent chemotherapy . 
D_D006973 and the combination of C_-1/C_C051890 may be additional risk factors for CIN development . 
KEY POINTS : . 
C_D003287-induced D_D007674 ( CIN ) is a concern for oncological patients undergoing CT. . 
CIN occurs more often when CT is performed < 45 days after chemotherapy . 
. 
D_D006973 and treatment with C_-1 appear to be additional risk factors .

title : D_D007177 secretion associated with C_C086816 . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : To report a case of D_D007177 ( D_D007177 ) secretion associated with C_C086816 . 
CASE SUMMARY : A 57-year old female with D_D007010 . 
Her medications included C_C086816 , and symptoms included D_D009325 , D_D001008 and D_D003221 . 
The serum C_D012964 at this time was 120 mmol/L , serum osmolality was 263 mosmol/kg , urine osmolality 410 mosmol/kg and urine C_D012964 63 mmol/L , consistent with a diagnosis of D_D007177 . 
C_C086816 was ceased and fluid restriction implemented . 
After 4 days the C_D012964 increased to 128 mmol/L and fluid restriction was relaxed . 
During her further 3 weeks inpatient admission the serum C_D012964 ranged from 134 to 137 mmol/L during treatment with C_C035133 . 
DISCUSSION : D_D007177 has been widely reported with a range of antidepressants . 
This case report suggests that C_C086816 might cause clinically significant D_D007010 . 
CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians should be aware of the potential for antidepressants to cause D_D007010 , and take appropriate corrective action where necessary .

title : Oxidative stress on D_D066126 after treatment with single and multiple doses of C_D004317 . 
abstract : The mechanism of C_D004317 ( C_D004317 ) -induced D_D066126 remains controversial . 
Wistar rats ( n = 66 ) received C_D004317 injections intraperitoneally and were randomly assigned to 2 experimental protocols : ( 1 ) rats were killed before ( -24 h , n = 8 ) and 24 h after ( +24 h , n = 8 ) a single dose of C_D004317 ( 4 mg/kg body weight ) to determine the C_D004317 acute effect and ( 2 ) rats ( n = 58 ) received 4 injections of C_D004317 ( 4 mg/kg body weight/week ) and were killed before the first injection ( M0 ) and 1 week after each injection ( M1 , M2 , M3 , and M4 ) to determine the chronological effects . 
Animals used at M0 ( n = 8 ) were also used at moment -24 h of acute study . 
Cardiac total antioxidant performance ( TAP ) , DNA damage , and morphology analyses were carried out at each time point . 
Single dose of C_D004317 was associated with increased D_D006331 , D_D009336 , and DNA damage ( strand breaks ( SBs ) and oxidized pyrimidines ) and decreased TAP . 
The chronological study showed an effect of a cumulative dose on body weight ( R = -0.99 , p = 0.011 ) , D_D009336 ( R = 1.00 , p = 0.004 ) , TAP ( R = 0.95 , p = 0.049 ) , and DNA SBs ( R = -0.95 , p = 0.049 ) . 
DNA SBs damage was negatively associated with TAP ( R = -0.98 , p = 0.018 ) , and D_D009336 ( R = -0.97 , p = 0.027 ) . 
Our results suggest that oxidative damage is associated with acute D_D066126 induced by a single dose of C_D004317 only . 
Increased resistance to the oxidative stress is plausible for the multiple dose of C_D004317 . 
Thus , different mechanisms may be involved in acute D_D064420 versus chronic D_D064420 .

title : C_D016559-related D_D012640 after pediatric liver transplantation -- a single-center experience . 
abstract : To identify the risk factors for new-onset D_D012640s after pediatric LT and to assess their clinical implications and long-term prognosis . 
The clinical and laboratory data of 27 consecutive children who underwent LT from January 2007 to December 2010 in our center were analyzed retrospectively . 
Patients were divided into D_D012640s group and a non-D_D012640s group . 
Pre-operative , intra-operative , and post-operative data were collected . 
D_D012640 occurred in four children , an incidence of 14.8 % . 
All exhibited generalized tonic-clonic D_D012640s within the first two wk after LT. Univariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with D_D012640s after pediatric LT included gender , pediatric D_D058625 score before surgery , Child-Pugh score before surgery , serum total C_D001663 after surgery , and trough C_D016559 level . 
Multivariate analysis showed that trough C_D016559 level was the only independent risk factor associated with the D_D012640s . 
All children who experienced D_D012640s survived with good graft function and remained D_D012640-free without anti-D_D004827 drugs over a mean follow-up period of 33.7 + 14.6 months . 
High trough C_D016559 level was the predominant factor that contributed to D_D012640s in the early post-operative period after pediatric LT. High PELD and Child-Pugh scores before LT and high post-operative serum Tbil may be contributory risk factors for C_D016559-related D_D012640s .

title : The C_D005419 C_D047310 delays forgetting of passive avoidance conditioning in rats . 
abstract : The present experiments were performed to study the effect of the C_D005419 C_D047310 ( 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally ( i.p . 
) , 1 h before acquisition ) , on 24 h retention performance and forgetting of a step-through passive avoidance task , in young male Wistar rats . 
There were no differences between saline- and C_D047310-treated groups in the 24 h retention trial . 
Furthermore , C_D047310 did not prevent the D_D000647 induced by C_D012601 ( 1mg/kg , i.p. , 30 min before the acquisition ) . 
The saline- and C_D047310-treated rats that did not step through into the dark compartment during the cut-off time ( 540 s ) were retested weekly for up to eight weeks . 
In the saline treated group , the first significant decline in passive avoidance response was observed at four weeks , and complete D_D008569 was found five weeks after the acquisition of the passive avoidance task . 
At the end of the experimental period , 60 % of the animals treated with C_D047310 still did not step through . 
These data suggest that 1 ) C_D047310 delays the long-term forgetting but did not modulate the 24 h retention of fear memory and 2 ) the obtained beneficial effect of C_D047310 on the passive avoidance conditioning is mediated by mechanisms that do not implicate its action on the muscarinic cholinergic system .

title : C_D012844 restored C_D009020-induced hippocampal long-term potentiation impairment in rats . 
abstract : C_D012844 ( C_D012844 ) , which is a typical brain-gut peptide , exerts a wide range of biological activities on the central nervous system . 
We have previously reported that C_D012844 significantly alleviated C_D009020-induced D_D000647 and reversed spine density decreases in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in C_D009020-treated animals . 
Here , we investigated the effects of C_D012844 on long-term potentiation ( LTP ) in the lateral perforant path ( LPP ) -granule cell synapse of rat dentate gyrus ( DG ) in acute saline or C_D009020-treated rats . 
Population spikes ( PS ) , which were evoked by stimulation of the LPP , were recorded in the DG region . 
Acute C_D009020 ( 30mg/kg , s.c. ) treatment significantly attenuated hippocampal LTP and C_D012844 ( 1ug , i.c.v . ) 
restored the amplitude of PS that was attenuated by C_D009020 injection . 
Furthermore , microinjection of C_D012844 ( 0.1 and 1ug , i.c.v . ) 
also significantly augmented hippocampal LTP in saline-treated ( 1ml/kg , s.c. ) rats . 
Pre-treatment of the CCK2 receptor antagonist L-365,260 ( 10ug , i.c.v ) reversed the effects of C_D012844 , but the CCK1 receptor antagonist L-364,718 ( 10ug , i.c.v ) did not . 
The present results demonstrate that C_D012844 attenuates the effect of C_D009020 on hippocampal LTP through CCK2 receptors and suggest an ameliorative function of C_D012844 on C_D009020-induced D_D008569 .

title : Glial activation and post-synaptic D_D020258 : the key events in C_D013311 ( ICV ) induced D_D008569 in rats . 
abstract : In the present study the role of glial activation and post synaptic D_D064420 in ICV C_D013311 ( C_D013311 ) induced D_D008569 rats was explored . 
In experiment set up 1 : D_D008569 was found in Morris water maze test on 14-16 days after C_D013311 ( ICV ; 3mg/Kg ) administration . 
C_D013311 causes increased expression of GFAP , CD11b and TNF-a indicating glial activation and D_D007249 . 
C_D013311 also significantly increased the level of ROS , C_D009573 , C_D002118 ( 2+ ) and reduced the mitochondrial activity in synaptosomal preparation illustrating free radical generation and excitoD_D064420 . 
Increased expression and activity of C_D002118spase-3 was also observed in C_D013311 treated rat which specify apoptotic cell death in hippocampus and cortex . 
C_D013311 treatment showed decrease expression of post synaptic markers C_D002118MKIIa and PSD-95 , while , expression of pre synaptic markers ( synaptophysin and SNAP-25 ) remains unaltered indicating selective post synaptic D_D020258 . 
Oral treatment with C_D008559 ( 10mg/kg ) and C_D007052 ( 50 mg/kg ) daily for 13 days attenuated C_D013311 induced glial activation , apoptotic cell death and post synaptic D_D020258 in rat brain . 
Further , in experiment set up 2 : where memory function was not affected i.e . 
7-9 days after C_D013311 treatment . 
The level of GFAP , CD11b , TNF-a , ROS and C_D009573 levels were increased . 
On the other hand , apoptotic marker , synaptic markers , mitochondrial activity and C_D002118 ( 2+ ) levels remained unaffected . 
Collective data indicates that D_D007249 process and oxidative stress occurs earlier to apoptosis and does not affect memory function . 
Present study clearly suggests that glial activation and post synaptic D_D020258 are the key factors in C_D013311 induced D_D008569 and neuronal cell death .

title : Comparison of effects of isotonic C_D012965 with C_D004110 in prevention of C_D003287-induced D_D007674 . 
abstract : INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE : C_D003287-induced D_D007674 ( CIN ) significantly increases the morbidity and mortality of patients . 
The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the protective effects of isotonic C_D012965 with C_D017693 infusion and isotonic C_D012965 infusion with C_D004110 , a C_D002118 channel blocker , in preventing CIN . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Our study included patients who were administered 30-60 mL of iodinated C_D003287 agent for percutaneous coronary angiography ( PCAG ) , all with C_D003404 values between 1.1 and 3.1 mg/dL . 
Patients were divided into three groups and each group had 20 patients . 
The first group of patients was administered isotonic C_D012965 ; the second group was administered a solution that of 5 % C_D005947 and C_D017693 , while the third group was administered isotonic C_D012965 before and after the C_D003287 injection . 
The third group received an additional injection of C_D004110 the day before and first 2 days after the C_D003287 injection . 
All of the patients ' plasma C_D001806 ( C_D001806 ) and C_D003404 levels were measured on the second and seventh day after the administration of intravenous C_D003287 material . 
RESULTS : The basal C_D003404 levels were similar for all three groups ( p > 0.05 ) . 
Among a total of 60 patients included in the study , 16 patients developed D_D058186 ( D_D058186 ) on the second day after C_D003287 material was injected ( 26.6 % ) . 
The number of patients who developed D_D058186 on the second day after the injection in the first group was five ( 25 % ) , in the second group was six ( 30 % ) and the third group was five ( 25 % ) ( p > 0.05 ) . 
CONCLUSION : There was no significant difference between isotonic C_D012965 , C_D017693 and isotonic C_D012965 with C_D004110 application in prevention of CIN .

title : Neurocognitive and neuroradiologic central nervous system late effects in children treated on Pediatric Oncology Group ( POG ) P9605 ( standard risk ) and P9201 ( lesser risk ) D_D054198 protocols ( ACCL0131 ) : a C_D008727 consequence ? 
A report from the Children 's Oncology Group . 
abstract : Concerns about long-term C_D008727 ( C_D008727 ) D_D020258 in the 1990s led to modifications in intrathecal ( IT ) therapy , leucovorin rescue , and frequency of systemic C_D008727 administration in children with D_D054198 . 
In this study , neurocognitive outcomes and neuroradiologic evidence of D_D056784 were compared in children treated with intense central nervous system ( CNS ) -directed therapy ( P9605 ) versus those receiving fewer CNS-directed treatment days during intensive consolidation ( P9201 ) . 
A total of 66 children from 16 Pediatric Oncology Group institutions with `` standard-risk '' D_D054198 , 1.00 to 9.99 years at diagnosis , without evidence of CNS D_D007938 at diagnosis were enrolled on ACCL0131 : 28 from P9201 and 38 from P9605 . 
Magnetic resonance imaging scans and standard neuropsychological tests were performed > 2.6 years after the end of treatment . 
Significantly more P9605 patients developed D_D056784 compared with P9201 patients ( 68 % , 95 % confidence interval 49 % -83 % vs. 22 % , 95 % confidence interval 5 % -44 % ; P=0.001 ) identified as late as 7.7 years after the end of treatment . 
Overall , 40 % of patients scored < 85 on either Verbal or Performance IQ . 
Children on both studies had significant D_D003072 , but P9605 children scored below average on more neurocognitive measures than those treated on P9201 ( 82 % , 14/17 measures vs. 24 % , 4/17 measures ) . 
This supports ongoing concerns about intensive C_D008727 exposure as a major contributor to CNS late effects .

title : C_D014148 overdosage-induced generalized D_D012640 in D_D051437 . 
abstract : We report a 45-year-old lady with D_D051436 stage 4 due to chronic D_D004194 . 
She was admitted to our center for severe D_D000740 due to D_D008595 and D_D051437 . 
She was infused three units of packed cells during a session of hemodialysis . 
C_D014148 ( C_D014148 ) 1 g 8-hourly was administered to her to control D_D006470 per vaginum . 
Two hours after the sixth dose of C_D014148 , she had an episode of generalized D_D004830 . 
C_D014148 was discontinued . 
Investigations of the patient revealed no biochemical or structural central D_D009421 that could have provoked the D_D012640 . 
She did not require any further dialytic support . 
She had no further episodes of D_D012640 till dis-charge and during the two months of follow-up . 
Thus , the precipitating cause of D_D012640 was believed to be an D_D062787 of C_D014148 .

title : Pre-treatment of C_D002045-induced D_D002318 using different lipid formulations of C_D015742 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Pre-treatment with lipid emulsions has been shown to increase lethal doses of C_D002045 , and the lipid content of C_D015742 may alleviate C_D002045-induced D_D066126 . 
The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of C_D015742 in intralipid or medialipid emulsions on C_D002045-induced D_D066126 . 
METHODS : Rats were anaesthetised with C_D007649 and were given 0.5 mg/kg/min C_D015742 in intralipid ( Group P ) , C_D015742 in medialipid ( Group L ) , or saline ( Group C ) over 20 min . 
Thereafter , 2 mg/kg/min C_D002045 0.5 % was infused . 
We recorded time to first D_D001145 occurrence , respective times to 25 % and 50 % reduction of the heart rate ( HR ) and mean arterial pressure , and time to D_D006323 and total amount of C_D002045 consumption . 
Blood and tissue samples were collected following D_D006323 . 
RESULTS : The time to first D_D001145 occurrence , time to 25 % and 50 % reductions in HR , and time to D_D006323 were longer in Group P than the other groups . 
The cumulative C_D002045 dose given at those time points was higher in Group P. Plasma C_D002045 levels were significantly lower in Group P than in Group C. C_D002045 levels in the brain and heart were significantly lower in Group P and Group L than in Group C. CONCLUSION : We conclude that pre-treatment with C_D015742 in intralipid , compared with C_D015742 in medialipid or saline , delayed the onset of C_D002045-induced D_D066126 effects as well as reduced plasma C_D002045 levels . 
Further studies are needed to explore tissue C_D002045 levels of C_D015742 in medialipid and adapt these results to clinical practice .

abstract : Although C_D019161 are generally well-tolerated drugs , recent cases of D_D056486 associated with their use have been reported . 
A 52-year-old Chinese man reported with D_D056486 , which appeared 12 hours after beginning treatment with C_C065180 . 
Patient presented with complaints of increasing D_D009325 , D_D000855 , and upper D_D015746 . 
His laboratory values showed elevated C_D003401 kinase and transaminases . 
Testing for autoantibodies was also negative . 
The liver biochemistries eventually normalized within 3 weeks of stopping the C_C065180 . 
Therefore , when prescribing C_D019161 , the possibility of D_D056486 should be taken into account .

abstract : CASE : We describe a second case of C_D015725 associated D_D000380 with D_D013921 and recovery upon discontinuation of therapy . 
The patient began to have changes in white blood cells and platelets within 48 h of administration of C_D015725 and began to recover with 48 h of discontinuation . 
This case highlights that drug-induced D_D006402 can occur unexpectedly as a result of treatment with a commonly used drug thought to be `` safe '' . 
CONCLUSION : According to Naranjo 's algorithm the likelihood that our patient 's D_D000380 and D_D013921 occurred as a result of therapy with C_D015725 is probable , with a total of six points . 
We feel that the weight of the overall evidence of this evidence is strong . 
In particular the temporal relationship of D_D001855 to the initiation of C_D015725 and the abatement of symptoms that rapidly reversed immediately following discontinuation .

title : Two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography combined with high-sensitive cardiac troponin T in early detection and prediction of D_D066126 during C_D015251-based chemotherapy . 
abstract : AIMS : To investigate whether alterations of D_D009202 and high-sensitive cardiac troponin T ( cTnT ) could predict future D_D006331 in patients after C_D015251 exposure . 
METHODS : Seventy-five patients with D_D008228 treated with C_D015251 were studied . 
Blood collection and echocardiography were performed at baseline , 1 day after the third cycle , and 1 day after completion of chemotherapy . 
Patients were studied using echocardiography during follow-up . 
Global longitudinal ( GLS ) , circumferential ( GCS ) , and radial strain ( GRS ) were calculated using speckle tracking echocardiography . 
Left ventricular ejection fraction was analysed by real-time 3D echocardiography . 
D_D066126 was defined as a reduction of the LVEF of > 5 % to < 55 % with symptoms of D_D006333 or an asymptomatic reduction of the LVEF of > 10 % to < 55 % . 
RESULTS : Fourteen patients ( 18.67 % ) developed D_D066126 after treatment . 
GLS ( -18.48 + 1.72 % vs. -15.96 + 1.6 % ) , GCS ( -20.93 + 2.86 % vs. -19.20 + 3.21 % ) , and GRS ( 39.23 + 6.44 % vs. 34.98 + 6.2 % ) were markedly reduced and cTnT was elevated from 0.0010 + 0.0020 to 0.0073 + 0.0038 ng/mL ( P all < 0.01 ) at the completion of chemotherapy compared with baseline values . 
A > 15.9 % decrease in GLS [ sensitivity , 86 % ; specificity , 75 % ; area under the curve ( AUC ) = 0.815 ; P = 0.001 ] and a > 0.004 ng/mL elevation in cTnT ( sensitivity , 79 % ; specificity , 64 % ; AUC = 0.757 ; P = 0.005 ) from baseline to the third cycle of chemotherapy predicted later D_D066126 . 
The decrease in GLS remained the only independent predictor of D_D066126 ( P = 0.000 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : GLS combined with cTnT may provide a reliable and non-invasive method to predict D_D006331 in patients receiving C_D018943-based chemotherapy .

title : Prevention of C_D005045-induced D_D009207 : which is superior : C_D005283 , C_D008874 , or a combination ? 
A Retrospective comparative study . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : In this retrospective comparative study , we aimed to compare the effectiveness of C_D005283 , C_D008874 , and a combination of C_D005283 and C_D008874 to prevent C_D005045-induced D_D009207 . 
MATERIAL AND METHODS : This study was performed based on anesthesia records . 
Depending on the drugs that would be given before the induction of anesthesia with C_D005045 , the patients were separated into 4 groups : no pretreatment ( Group NP ) , C_D005283 1 ug.kg-1 ( Group F ) , C_D008874 0.03 mg.kg-1 ( Group M ) , and C_D008874 0.015 mg.kg-1 + C_D005283 0.5 ug.kg-1 ( Group FM ) . 
Patients who received the same anesthetic procedure were selected : 2 minutes after intravenous injections of the pretreatment drugs , anesthesia is induced with 0.3 mg.kg-1 C_D005045 injected intravenously over a period of 20-30 seconds . 
D_D009069 are evaluated , which were observed and graded according to clinical severity during the 2 minutes after C_D005045 injection . 
The severity of D_D010146 due to C_D005045 injection , mean arterial pressure , heart rate , and adverse effects were also evaluated . 
RESULTS : Study results showed that D_D009207 incidence was 85 % , 40 % , 70 % , and 25 % in Group NP , Group F , Group M , and Group FM , respectively , and were significantly lower in Group F and Group FM . 
CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that pretreatment with C_D005283 or combination of C_D005283 and C_D008874 was effective in preventing C_D005045-induced D_D009207 .

title : Paradoxical severe D_D011595 induced by add-on high-doses C_C069541 in D_D011618 . 
abstract : We report the case of a 35-year-old patient suffering from D_D011618 since the age of 19 years , treated by a combination of first-generation antipsychotics , C_D003006 ( 100 mg/day ) and C_D008094 ( 1200 mg/day ) ( serum C_D008094=0.85 mEq/l ) . 
This patient had no associated D_D010554 ( particularly no D_D000987 ) and no D_D019966 . 
Within the 48 h following the gradual introduction of C_C069541 ( up to 600 mg/day ) , the patient presented severe D_D011595 without an environmental explanation , contrasting with the absence of a history of D_D010554 or D_D010554 . 
The diagnoses of D_D001714 shift and D_D017109 were dismissed . 
The withdrawal and the gradual reintroduction of C_C069541 2 weeks later , which led to another severe D_D011595 , enabled us to attribute the D_D011595 specifically to C_C069541 .

title : Antioxidant effects of bovine lactoferrin on C_D003907-induced D_D006973 in rat . 
abstract : C_D003907- ( C_D003907- ) induced D_D006973 is associated with enhanced oxidative stress . 
Lactoferrin ( LF ) is an C_D007501-binding glycoprotein with antihypertensive properties . 
In this study , we investigated the effect of chronic administration of LF on oxidative stress and D_D006973 upon C_D003907 administration . 
Male Wistar rats were treated by C_D003907 ( 30 u g/kg/day subcutaneously ) or saline for 14 days . 
Oral bovine LF ( 30 , 100 , 300 mg/kg ) was given from day 8 to 14 in a reversal study . 
In a prevention study , rats received 4 days of LF treatment followed by C_D003907 and continued during the test period . 
Systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) was measured using tail-cuff method . 
Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity . 
Plasma C_D006861 ( C_D006861 ) concentration and ferric reducing antioxidant power ( FRAP ) value were determined . 
C_D003907 significantly increased SBP and plasma C_D006861 level and decreased thymus and body weights . 
LF lowered ( P < 0.01 ) and dose dependently prevented ( P < 0.001 ) C_D003907-induced D_D006973 . 
LF prevented body D_D015431 and significantly reduced the elevated plasma C_D006861 and increased FRAP values . 
Chronic administration of LF strongly reduced the blood pressure and production of ROS and improved antioxidant capacity in C_D003907-induced D_D006973 , suggesting the role of inhibition of oxidative stress as another mechanism of antihypertensive action of LF .

title : The association between C_D014148 and D_D012640 D_D012640 after cardiac surgery : a multivariate analysis in 11 529 patients . 
abstract : Because of a lack of contemporary data regarding D_D012640 after cardiac surgery , we undertook a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 11 529 patients in whom cardiopulmonary bypass was used from January 2004 to December 2010 . 
A D_D012640 D_D012640 was defined as a transient episode of disturbed brain function characterised by D_D004409 . 
Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of postoperative D_D012640 . 
A total of 100 ( 0.9 % ) patients developed postoperative D_D012640 D_D012640 . 
Generalised and focal D_D012640 were identified in 68 and 32 patients , respectively . 
The median ( IQR [ range ] ) time after surgery when the D_D012640 occurred was 7 ( 6-12 [ 1-216 ] ) h and 8 ( 6-11 [ 4-18 ] ) h , respectively . 
Epileptiform findings on electroencephalography were seen in 19 patients . 
Independent predictors of postoperative D_D012640 included age , female sex , redo cardiac surgery , calcification of ascending aorta , D_D006333 , deep D_D007035 circulatory arrest , duration of aortic cross-clamp and C_D014148 . 
When tested in a multivariate regression analysis , C_D014148 was a strong independent predictor of D_D012640 ( OR 14.3 , 95 % CI 5.5-36.7 ; p < 0.001 ) . 
Patients with D_D012640 D_D012640 had 2.5 times higher in-hospital mortality rates and twice the length of hospital stay compared with patients without D_D012640 D_D012640 . 
Mean ( IQR [ range ] ) length of stay in the intensive care unit was 115 ( 49-228 [ 32-481 ] ) h in patients with D_D012640 D_D012640 compared with 26 ( 22-69 [ 14-1080 ] ) h in patients without D_D012640 ( p < 0.001 ) . 
D_D012640 D_D012640 are a serious D_D011183 after cardiac surgery . 
As C_D014148 is the only modifiable factor , its administration , particularly in doses exceeding 80 mg.kg ( -1 ) , should be weighed against the risk of postoperative D_D012640 .

title : D_D008569 consolidation in C_D018817 users . 
abstract : Sleep plays an important role in the consolidation and integration of memory in a process called overnight memory consolidation . 
Previous studies indicate that C_D018817 users have marked and persistent neurocognitive and D_D012893 . 
We extend past research by examining overnight memory consolidation among regular C_D018817 users ( n=12 ) and drug naive healthy controls ( n=26 ) . 
Memory recall of word pairs was evaluated before and after a period of sleep , with and without interference prior to testing . 
In addition , we assessed neurocognitive performances across tasks of learning , memory and executive functioning . 
C_D018817 users demonstrated D_D008569 consolidation , a finding that was more pronounced following associative interference . 
Additionally , C_D018817 users demonstrated impairments on tasks recruiting frontostriatal and hippocampal neural circuitry , in the domains of proactive interference memory , long-term memory , encoding , working memory and complex planning . 
We suggest that C_D018817-associated dysfunction in fronto-temporal circuitry may underlie overnight consolidation D_D008569 in regular C_D018817 users .

title : Normoammonemic D_D001927 : solely C_D014635 induced or multiple mechanisms ? 
abstract : A 77-year-old woman presented with subacute onset progressive D_D003221 , D_D001523 , D_D006212 and D_D003072 . 
In the preceding months , the patient had a number of admissions with transient unilateral D_D010291 with facial droop , and had been started on C_D014635 for presumed D_D020325 . 
C_D014635 was withdrawn soon after admission and her cognitive abilities have gradually improved over 3 months of follow-up . 
C_D014635 levels taken prior to withdrawal were subtherapeutic and the patient was normoammonaemic . 
EEG undertaken during inpatient stay showed changes consistent with D_D001927 , and low titre C_D016202 ( C_D016202 ) receptor antibodies were present in this patient . 
The possible aetiologies of C_D014635-induced D_D001927 and C_D016202 receptor-associated D_D004660 present a diagnostic dilemma . 
We present a putative combinatorial hypothesis to explain this patient 's symptoms .

title : Cerebellar and oculomotor dysfunction induced by rapid infusion of C_D008614 . 
abstract : C_D008614 is an opioid that gains its popularity for the effective D_D010146 control through acting on the opioid-receptors . 
However , rapid D_D010146 relief sometimes brings about unfavourable side effects that largely limit its clinical utility . 
Common side effects include D_D009325 , D_D014839 and D_D007022 . 
In patients with impaired renal and liver function , and those who need long-term D_D010146 control , C_D008614 may cause excitatory central nervous system ( CNS ) effects through its D_D020258 metabolite , norC_D008614 , resulting in D_D001523 and D_D012640 attack . 
On the contrary , though not clinically apparent , C_D008614 potentially causes inhibitory impacts on the CNS and impairs normal cerebellar and oculomotor function in the short term . 
In this case report , we highlight opioid 's inhibitory side effects on the cerebellar structure that causes D_D002524 , D_D004401 , reduced smooth pursuit gain and decreased saccadic velocity .

title : D_-1 induced by C_D007654 . 
abstract : A 27-year-old male patient presented with a D_D003875 on the flexural areas and buttocks after using oral C_D007654 . 
The patient was diagnosed with drug-induced D_-1 based on his history , which included prior sensitivity to topical C_D007654 , a physical examination , and histopathological findings . 
D_-1 is a drug- or contact allergen-related D_D003875 that typically involves the flexural and gluteal areas . 
To the best of our knowledge , this is the first reported case of C_D007654-induced D_-1 in the English literature .

title : A Case of D_D016757 due to C_C042288-Induced D_D016171 . 
abstract : An 84-year-old male received oral C_C042288 , a pure C_D012964 channel blocker with slow recovery kinetics , to convert his paroxysmal D_D001281 to a sinus rhythm ; the patient developed D_D016757 two days later . 
The Holter electrocardiogram , which was worn by chance , revealed D_D016171 with gradually prolonged QT intervals . 
This drug is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract , and most of it is excreted from the kidney . 
Although the patient 's renal function was not highly impaired and the dose of C_C042288 was low , the plasma concentration of C_C042288 may have been high , which can produce D_D016171 in the octogenarian . 
Although the oral administration of class IC drugs , including C_C042288 , is effective to terminate D_D001281 , careful consideration must be taken before giving these drugs to octogenarians .

Only a handful of cases of C_D014212-induced D_D009220 in children have been reported , and none in the radiology literature . 
We present such a case in a 15-year-old boy with D_D015473 , where recognition of imaging findings played a crucial role in making the diagnosis and facilitated prompt , effective treatment .

title : Tolerability of C_D008130 in combination with C_D003520 in dogs with D_D008223 . 
abstract : This retrospective study describes D_D064420 associated with a protocol of C_D008130 ( C_D008130 ) and C_D003520 ( C_D003520 ) in dogs with D_D008223 . 
C_D008130 was administered per os ( PO ) at a targeted dosage of 60 mg/m ( 2 ) body surface area on day 0 , C_D003520 was administered PO at a targeted dosage of 250 mg/m ( 2 ) divided over days 0 through 4 , and all dogs received prophylactic antibiotics . 
Ninety treatments were given to the 57 dogs included in the study . 
D_D009503 was the principal toxic effect , and the overall frequency of grade 4 D_D009503 after the first treatment of C_D008130/C_D003520 was 30 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 19-43 % ) . 
The mean body weight of dogs with grade 4 D_D009503 ( 19.7 kg + 13.4 kg ) was significantly less than the mean body weight of dogs that did not develop grade 4 D_D009503 ( 31.7 kg + 12.4 kg ; P = .005 ) . 
One dog ( 3 % ) developed hematologic changes suggestive of hepatoD_D064420 . 
No dogs had evidence of either renal D_D064420 or hemorrhagic cystitis . 
Adverse gastrointestinal effects were uncommon . 
On the basis of the findings reported herein , a dose of 60 mg/m ( 2 ) of C_D008130 combined with 250 mg/m ( 2 ) of C_D003520 ( divided over 5 days ) q 4 wk is tolerable in D_D009369-bearing dogs .

title : C_C104457 D_D020258 with concurrent intrathecal chemotherapy : Case report and review of literature . 
abstract : Severe C_C104457 D_D020258 in a patient who received concurrent intrathecal ( IT ) chemotherapy is reported . 
A 37-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of D_D054218 was admitted for relapsed disease . 
She was originally treated with induction chemotherapy followed by an autologous transplant . 
She developed relapsed disease 10 months later with D_D007938 involvement . 
She was re-induced with C_C104457 1500 mg/m ( 2 ) on days 1 , 3 , and 5 with 1 dose of IT C_D003561 100 mg on day 2 as central nervous system ( CNS ) prophylaxis . 
At the time of treatment , she was on continuous renal replacement therapy due to sequelae of D_D015275 ( D_D015275 ) . 
She tolerated therapy well , entered a complete remission , and recovered her renal function . 
She received a second cycle of C_C104457 without additional IT prophylaxis one month later . 
A week after this second cycle , she noted numbness in her lower extremities . 
Predominantly sensory , though also motor and autonomic , D_D010523 started in her feet , ascended proximally to the mid-thoracic region , and eventually included her distal upper extremities . 
A magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of her spine demonstrated changes from C2 to C6 consistent with subacute combined degeneration . 
C_C104457 was felt to be the cause of her symptoms . 
Her D_D009422 stabilized and showed slight improvement and ultimately received an unrelated , reduced-intensity allogeneic transplant while in complete remission , but relapsed disease 10 weeks later . 
She is currently being treated with best supportive care . 
To our knowledge , this is the first published case report of severe D_D020258 caused by C_C104457 in a patient who received concurrent IT chemotherapy .

C_D014635-induced D_D022124 D_D001927 is an uncommon but serious effect of C_D014635 treatment . 
Here , we describe the case of a 15-year-old girl who was on a long-term therapy with C_D014635 due to D_D004827 and revealed D_D003244 with D_D022124 12 days after renal transplantation . 
After withdraw of C_D014635 , patients ' symptoms resolved within 24 h. Clinicians should increase their awareness for potential complication of C_D014635 , especially in transplanted patients .

abstract : C_C400082 and high-dose C_D003907-containing regimens are considered to be generally tolerable with few severe D_D001424 in patients with B-cell D_D009369 . 
However , information is limited concerning the safety of the regimen in elderly patients . 
We report a case of a 76-year-old man with D_D008258 who suffered D_D019115 without D_D009503 after the combination treatment with C_C400082 , high-dose C_D003907 and rituximab . 
Despite immediate intravenous antimicrobial therapy , he succumbed 23 h after the onset . 
Physicians should recognise the possibility of fatal D_D001424 related to C_C400082 plus high-dose C_D003907 in elderly patients , and we believe this case warrants further investigation .

title : An integrated characterization of serological , pathological , and functional events in C_D004317-induced D_D066126 . 
abstract : Many efficacious D_D009369 treatments cause significant cardiac morbidity , yet biomarkers or functional indices of early damage , which would allow monitoring and intervention , are lacking . 
In this study , we have utilized a rat model of progressive C_D004317 ( C_D004317 ) -induced D_D009202 , applying multiple approaches , including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , to provide the most comprehensive characterization to date of the timecourse of serological , pathological , and functional events underlying this D_D064420 . 
Hannover Wistar rats were dosed with 1.25 mg/kg C_D004317 weekly for 8 weeks followed by a 4 week off-dosing `` recovery '' period . 
Electron microscopy of the myocardium revealed D_D009410 and marked mitochondrial changes after a single dose . 
Histopathological analysis revealed progressive D_D009410 , D_D006984/cytomegaly , and extensive vacuolation after two doses . 
Extensive replacement D_D005355 ( quantified by Sirius red staining ) developed during the off-dosing period . 
Functional indices assessed by cardiac MRI ( including left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , cardiac output , and E/A ratio ) declined progressively , reaching statistical significance after two doses and culminating in `` clinical '' D_D018487 by 12 weeks . 
Significant increases in peak myocardial contrast enhancement and serological cardiac troponin I ( cTnI ) emerged after eight doses , importantly preceding the LVEF decline to < 50 % . 
Troponin I levels positively correlated with delayed and peak C_D005682 contrast enhancement , histopathological grading , and D_D018754 . 
In summary , subcellular D_D009410 was the earliest marker , followed by progressive functional decline and histopathological manifestations . 
Myocardial contrast enhancement and elevations in cTnI occurred later . 
However , all indices predated `` clinical '' D_D018487 and thus warrant further evaluation as predictive biomarkers .

title : Intradermal C_D018698 and C_D002211 injections : intra- and interindividual variability of provoked D_D006930 and D_D006930 . 
abstract : Intradermal injections of C_D018698 and C_D002211 are attractive to use in human experimental D_D010146 models because D_D006930 and D_D006930 mimic isolated aspects of clinical D_D010146 disorders . 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the reproducibility of these models . 
Twenty healthy male volunteers ( mean age 24 years ; range 18-38 years ) received intradermal injections of C_D018698 and C_D002211 in the volar forearm . 
Magnitudes of secondary pinprick D_D006930 and brush-evoked D_D006930 were investigated using von Frey filaments ( gauges 10 , 15 , 60 and 100 g ) and brush strokes . 
Areas of secondary D_D006930 and D_D006930 were quantified immediately after injection and after 15 , 30 and 60 min . 
Two identical experiments separated by at least 7 days were performed . 
Reproducibility across and within volunteers ( inter- and intra-individual variation , respectively ) was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) and coefficient of variation ( CV ) . 
Secondary pinprick D_D006930 was observed as a marked increase in the visual analogue scale ( VAS ) response to von Frey gauges 60 and 100 g ( P < 0.001 ) after C_D018698 injection . 
For C_D002211 , secondary pinprick D_D006930 was detected with all von Frey gauges ( P < 0.001 ) . 
C_D018698 evoked reproducible VAS response to all von Frey gauges ( ICC > 0.60 ) and brush strokes ( ICC > 0.83 ) . 
C_D002211 injection was reproducible for secondary D_D006930 ( ICC > 0.70 ) and D_D006930 ( ICC > 0.71 ) . 
Intra-individual variability was generally lower for the VAS response to von Frey and brush compared with areas of secondary D_D006930 and D_D006930 . 
In conclusion , C_D018698 and C_D002211 yield reproducible D_D006930 and D_D006930 responses , and the present model is well suited for basic research , as well as for assessing the modulation of central phenomena .

title : Ocular-specific ER stress reduction rescues D_D005901 in murine glucocorticoid-induced D_D005901 . 
abstract : Administration of glucocorticoids induces D_D009798 in some patients . 
If untreated , these patients can develop a secondary D_D005901 that resembles primary open-angle D_D005901 ( D_C562750 ) . 
The underlying pathology of glucocorticoid-induced D_D005901 is not fully understood , due in part to lack of an appropriate animal model . 
Here , we developed a murine model of glucocorticoid-induced D_D005901 that exhibits D_D005901 features that are observed in patients . 
Treatment of WT mice with topical ocular 0.1 % C_D003907 led to elevation of intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , functional and structural loss of D_D012173 cells , and D_D009410 , resembling glucocorticoid-induced D_D005901 in human patients . 
Furthermore , C_D003907-induced D_D009798 was associated with chronic ER stress of the trabecular meshwork ( TM ) . 
Similar to patients , withdrawal of C_D003907 treatment reduced elevated IOP and ER stress in this animal model . 
C_D003907 induced the transcriptional factor CHOP , a marker for chronic ER stress , in the anterior segment tissues , and Chop deletion reduced ER stress in these tissues and prevented C_D003907-induced D_D009798 . 
Furthermore , reduction of ER stress in the TM with C_C075773 prevented C_D003907-induced D_D009798 in WT mice . 
Our data indicate that ER stress contributes to glucocorticoid-induced D_D009798 and suggest that reducing ER stress has potential as a therapeutic strategy for treating glucocorticoid-induced D_D005901 .

title : Effects of C_D036145 on opioid-induced D_D006930 in mice . 
abstract : Opioid-induced D_D006930 ( D_D006930 ) is characterized by nociceptive sensitization caused by the cessation of chronic opioid use . 
D_D006930 can limit the clinical use of opioid analgesics and complicate withdrawal from D_D009293 . 
In this study , we investigated the effects of C_C049864 , C_C035054 , and C_C442759 C_D036145 , the bioactive components of ginseng , on D_D006930 . 
D_D006930 was achieved in mice after subcutaneous administration of C_D009020 for 7 consecutive days three times per day . 
During withdrawal ( days 8 and 9 ) , these mice were administered C_C049864 , C_C035054 , or C_C442759 intragastrically two times per day . 
On the test day ( day 10 ) , mice were subjected to the thermal sensitivity test and the C_D019342-induced writhing test . 
C_C049864 ( 300 mg/kg ) inhibited D_D006930 in both the thermal sensitivity test and the C_D019342-induced writhing test . 
However , the C_C035054 and C_C442759 C_D036145 failed to prevent D_D006930 in either test . 
Furthermore , C_C035054 showed a tendency to aggravate D_D006930 in the C_D019342-induced writhing test . 
Our data suggested that the ginsenoside C_C049864 , but not C_C035054 or C_C442759 , may contribute toward reversal of D_D006930 .

SETTING : Neurocritical care units at two academic medical centers with dedicated neurocritical care teams and board-certified neurointensivists . 
PATIENTS : Neurocritical care patients admitted between July 2009 and September 2012 were evaluated and then matched 1:1 based on propensity scoring of baseline characteristics . 
INTERVENTIONS : Continuous sedation with C_D020927 or C_D015742 . 
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : A total of 342 patients ( 105 C_D020927 and 237 C_D015742 ) were included in the analysis , with 190 matched ( 95 in each group ) by propensity score . 
The primary outcome of this study was a composite of severe D_D007022 ( mean arterial pressure < 60 mm Hg ) and D_D001919 ( heart rate < 50 beats/min ) during sedative infusion . 
No difference in the primary composite outcome in both the unmatched ( 30 % vs 30 % , p = 0.94 ) or matched cohorts ( 28 % vs 34 % , p = 0.35 ) could be found . 
When analyzed separately , no differences could be found in the prevalence of severe D_D007022 or D_D001919 in either the unmatched or matched cohorts . 
CONCLUSIONS : Severe D_D007022 and D_D001919 occur at similar prevalence in neurocritical care patients who receive C_D020927 or C_D015742 . 
Providers should similarly consider the likelihood of D_D007022 or D_D001919 before starting either sedative .

title : C_C005975 ameliorates oxidative stress and D_D028361 in C_D004317-induced D_D066126 in rats with D_D001943 . 
abstract : Oxidative stress is involved in several processes including D_D009369 , aging and D_D002318 , and has been shown to potentiate the therapeutic effect of drugs such as C_D004317 . 
C_D004317 causes significant D_D066126 characterized by marked increases in oxidative stress and D_D028361 . 
Herein , we investigate whether C_D004317-associated chronic D_D066126 can be ameliorated with the antioxidant C_C005975 in rats with D_D001943 . 
Thirty-six rats bearing D_D001943 induced chemically were divided into 4 groups : control , C_C005975 ( 0.5mg/kg , 5days/week ) , C_D004317 ( 1mg/kg/week ) , and C_D004317 plus C_C005975 . 
D_D006331 at the cellular and mitochondrial level , mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I-IV and apoptosis-inducing factor , and oxidative stress markers have been analyzed . 
C_C005975 improved the D_D006331 enhanced by C_D004317 by significantly reducing the percentage of altered mitochondria and oxidative damage . 
These results suggest that C_C005975 improve the mitochondrial electron transport chain . 
This study demonstrates that C_C005975 protect rat D_D006331 provoked by C_D004317 decreasing oxidative damage and mitochondrial alterations .

title : C_D000638-induced myxoedema coma . 
abstract : A 62-year-old man was found to have D_D001919 , D_D007035 and D_D012131 3 weeks after initiation of C_D000638 therapy for D_D001281 . 
Thyroid-stimulating hormone was found to be 168 uIU/mL ( nl . 
0.3-5 uIU/mL ) and free C_D013974 ( FT4 ) was < 0.2 ng/dL ( nl . 
0.8-1.8 ng/dL ) . 
He received intravenous fluids , vasopressor therapy and stress dose C_D013256 ; he was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit . 
He received 500 ug of intravenous levoC_D013974 in the first 18 h of therapy , and 150 ug intravenous daily thereafter . 
Haemodynamic improvement , along with complete recovery of mental status , occurred after 48 h. Twelve hours after the initiation of therapy , FT4 was 0.96 ng/dL . 
The patient was maintained on levoC_D013974 175 ( g POorally daily . 
A thyroid ultrasound showed diffuse heterogeneity . 
The 24 hour excretion of C_D007455 was 3657 ( mcg ( 25-756 ( mcg ) . 
The only two cases of C_D000638-induced myxoedema coma in the literature report patient death despite supportive therapy and thyroid hormone replacement . 
This case represents the most thoroughly investigated case of C_D000638-induced myxoedema coma with a history significant for subclinical D_D013959 .

title : Use of C_C031942 and catheter-directed D_D055499 with alteplase in an oncology patient with C_D006493-induced D_D013921 with D_D013927 . 
abstract : PURPOSE : The case of an oncology patient who developed C_D006493-induced D_D013921 with D_D013927 ( D_D013921|D013927 ) and was treated with C_C031942 plus catheter-directed D_D055499 ( CDT ) with alteplase is presented . 
SUMMARY : A 63-year-old Caucasian man with renal D_D000686 undergoing peripheral blood stem cell collection for an autologous stem cell transplant developed extensive bilateral upper-extremity deep venous D_D013927 ( D_D020246 ) and D_D011655 secondary to C_D006493-induced D_D013921 . 
A continuous i.v . 
infusion of C_C031942 was initiated , and the patient was managed on the general medical floor . 
After one week of therapy , he was transferred to the intensive care unit with cardiopulmonary compromise related to D_D013479 . 
A percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy and CDT with alteplase were attempted , but the procedure was aborted due to D_D004844 . 
The D_D004844 resolved the next day , and the patient was restarted on C_C031942 . 
A second percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy was performed six days later and resulted in partial revascularization of the SVC and central veins . 
Postthrombectomy continuous CDT with alteplase was commenced while C_C031942 was withheld , and complete patency of the SVC and central veins was achieved after three days of therapy . 
Alteplase was discontinued , and the patient was reinitiated on C_C031942 ; ultimately , he was transitioned to C_D014859 for long-term anticoagulation . 
Although the patient recovered , he experienced permanent vision and hearing loss , as well as D_D007676 . 
CONCLUSION : A 63-year-old man with renal D_D000686 and D_D013479 secondary to D_D013921|D013927 was successfully treated with C_C031942 and CDT with alteplase .

title : Effects of C_D003687 in C_D000661-induced D_D012559 models in mice . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : To examine the effects of C_D003687 ( C_D003687 ) on animal models of D_D012559 . 
METHODS : Seventy Swiss albino female mice ( 25-35 g ) were divided into 4 groups : C_D000661-free ( control ) , C_D000661 , 50 , and 100 mg/kg C_D003687 . 
The C_D003687 was administered intraperitoneally ( ip ) for 5 days . 
C_D000661 ( 3 mg/kg ip ) induced D_D006948 locomotion , C_D001058 ( 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously [ sc ] ) induced climbing , and C_D006220 ( 1.5 mg/kg sc ) induced D_D002375 tests were used as animal models of D_D012559 . 
The study was conducted at the Animal Experiment Laboratories , Department of Pharmacology , Medical School , Eskisehir Osmangazi University , Eskisehir , Turkey between March and May 2012 . 
Statistical analysis was carried out using Kruskal-Wallis test for D_D006948 locomotion , and one-way ANOVA for climbing and D_D002375 tests . 
RESULTS : In the C_D000661-induced locomotion test , there were significant increases in all movements compared with the C_D000661-free group . 
Both C_D003687 50 mg/kg ( p < 0.05 ) , and 100 mg/kg ( p < 0.01 ) significantly decreased all movements compared with the C_D000661-induced locomotion group . 
There was a significant difference between groups in the C_D006220-induced D_D002375 test ( p < 0.05 ) . 
There was no significant difference between groups in terms of total climbing time in the C_D001058-induced climbing test ( p > 0.05 ) . 
CONCLUSION : We observed that C_D003687 reduced locomotor activity and increased D_D002375 at both doses , while it had no effect on climbing behavior . 
We suggest that C_D003687 displays typical neuroleptic-like effects , and may be used in the treatment of D_D012559 .

title : Availability of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in assessment of drug potential for D_D008133 . 
abstract : Field potential duration ( FPD ) in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes ( hiPS-CMs ) , which can express QT interval in an electrocardiogram , is reported to be a useful tool to predict C_D011188 ( + ) channel and C_D002118 ( 2+ ) channel blocker effects on QT interval . 
However , there is no report showing that this technique can be used to predict multichannel blocker potential for D_D008133 . 
The aim of this study is to show that FPD from MEA ( Multielectrode array ) of hiPS-CMs can detect D_D008133 induced by multichannel blockers . 
hiPS-CMs were seeded onto MEA and FPD was measured for 2min every 10min for 30min after drug exposure for the vehicle and each drug concentration . 
IC_D011188r and IC_D011188s blockers concentration-dependently prolonged corrected FPD ( FPDc ) , whereas C_D002118 ( 2+ ) channel blockers concentration-dependently shortened FPDc . 
Also , the multichannel blockers C_D000638 , C_D017374 , C_D016593 and C_D015283 prolonged FPDc in a concentration dependent manner . 
Finally , the IC_D011188r blockers , C_D016593 and C_D015283 , which are reported to cause D_D016171 ( D_D016171 ) in clinical practice , produced early afterdepolarization ( EAD ) . 
hiPS-CMs using MEA system and FPDc can predict the effects of drug candidates on QT interval . 
This study also shows that this assay can help detect EAD for drugs with D_D016171 potential .

title : Dermal developmental D_D064420 of N-phenylimide herbicides in rats . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : C_C106487 and C_C083440 are N-phenylimide herbicides and produced D_D020964 , D_D064793 ( mainly D_D006345 and wavy ribs ) , and D_D005317 in rats in conventional oral developmental D_D064420 studies . 
Our objective in this study was to investigate whether the compounds induce developmental D_D064420 via the dermal route , which is more relevant to occupational exposure , hence better addressing human health risks . 
METHODS : C_C106487 was administered dermally to rats at 30 , 100 , and 300 mg/kg during organogenesis , and C_C083440 was administered at 200 , 400 , and 800 mg/kg ( the maximum applicable dose level ) . 
Fetuses were obtained by a Cesarean section and examined for external , visceral , and skeletal alterations . 
RESULTS : Dermal exposure of rats to C_C106487 at 300 mg/kg produced patterns of developmental D_D064420 similar to those resulting from oral exposure . 
D_D064420 included D_D020964 , D_D064793 , and D_D005317 . 
Dermal administration of C_C083440 at 800 mg/kg resulted in an increased incidence of D_D020964 and D_D006345 , but retarded fetal growth was not observed as it was following oral exposure to C_C083440 . 
CONCLUSIONS : Based on the results , C_C106487 and C_C083440 were D_D064793 when administered dermally to pregnant rats as were the compounds administered orally . 
Thus , investigation of the mechanism and its human relevancy become more important .

title : Rates of D_D007674 in D_D009369 Patients Receiving C_D002945 With and Without C_D008353 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : C_D002945 is a widely used antineoplastic . 
One of the major complications of C_D002945 use is dose-limiting D_D007674 . 
There are many strategies to prevent this D_D064420 , including the use of C_D008353 as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration . 
OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of C_D002945-induced D_D007674 in D_D009369 patients receiving single-agent C_D002945 with and without C_D008353 . 
METHODS : This single-center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national C_D008353 shortage . 
Data were collected on adult D_D009369 patients receiving single-agent C_D002945 as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 . 
The primary outcome was D_D058186 ( D_D058186 ) . 
RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single-agent C_D002945 ; 97.2 % of patients had head and neck D_D009369 as their primary D_D009369 . 
Patients who did not receive C_D008353 were more likely to develop D_D007674 : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2.646 ( 95 % CI = 1.008 , 6.944 ; P = 0.048 ) . 
Patients who received the 100 mg/m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of D_D006973 also had a higher likelihood of developing D_D007674 : OR = 11.494 ( 95 % CI = 4.149 , 32.258 ; P < 0.0001 ) and OR = 3.219 ( 95 % CI = 1.228 , 8.439 ; P = 0.017 ) , respectively . 
CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of C_D008353 are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of D_D007674 . 
Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg/m ( 2 ) C_D002945 every 3 weeks and those with D_D006973 are at the greatest risk of D_D007674 and would benefit from the addition of C_D008353 .

title : C_D008687 protects against D_D012640 , learning and memory impairments and oxidative damage induced by C_D010433-induced kindling in mice . 
abstract : D_D003072 , the most common and severe comorbidity of D_D004827 , greatly diminishes the quality of life . 
However , current therapeutic interventions for D_D004827 can also cause untoward cognitive effects . 
Thus , there is an urgent need for new kinds of agents targeting both D_D012640 and D_D003072 . 
Oxidative stress is considered to play an important role in epileptogenesis and D_D003072 , and antioxidants have a putative antiepileptic potential . 
C_D008687 , the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic oral drug , has antioxidant properties . 
This study was designed to evaluate the ameliorative effects of C_D008687 on D_D012640 , D_D003072 and brain oxidative stress markers observed in C_D010433-induced kindling animals . 
Male C57BL/6 mice were administered with subconvulsive dose of C_D010433 ( 37 mg/kg , i.p . ) 
every other day for 14 injections . 
C_D008687 was injected intraperitoneally in dose of 200mg/kg along with alternate-day C_D010433 . 
We found that C_D008687 suppressed the progression of kindling , ameliorated the D_D003072 and decreased brain oxidative stress . 
Thus the present study concluded that C_D008687 may be a potential agent for the treatment of D_D004827 as well as a protective medicine against D_D003072 induced by D_D012640 .

title : P53 inhibition exacerbates late-stage C_D018943 D_D066126 . 
abstract : AIMS : C_D004317 ( C_D004317 ) is an effective anti-D_D009369 therapeutic , but is associated with both acute and late-stage D_D066126 . 
Children are particularly sensitive to C_D004317-induced D_D006333 . 
Here , the impact of p53 inhibition on acute vs. late-stage C_D004317 D_D066126 was examined in a juvenile model . 
METHODS AND RESULTS : Two-week-old MHC-CB7 mice ( which express dominant-interfering p53 in cardiomyocytes ) and their non-transgenic ( NON-TXG ) littermates received weekly C_D004317 injections for 5 weeks ( 25 mg/kg cumulative dose ) . 
One week after the last C_D004317 treatment ( acute stage ) , MHC-CB7 mice exhibited improved cardiac function and lower levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with the NON-TXG mice . 
Surprisingly , by 13 weeks following the last C_D004317 treatment ( late stage ) , MHC-CB7 exhibited a progressive decrease in cardiac function and higher rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with NON-TXG mice . 
p53 inhibition blocked transient C_D004317-induced STAT3 activation in MHC-CB7 mice , which was associated with enhanced induction of the DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80 . 
Mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of STAT3 exhibited worse cardiac function , higher levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis , and a greater induction of Ku70 and Ku80 in response to C_D004317 treatment during the acute stage when compared with control animals . 
CONCLUSION : These data support a model wherein a p53-dependent cardioprotective pathway , mediated via STAT3 activation , mitigates C_D004317-induced myocardial stress during drug delivery . 
Furthermore , these data suggest an explanation as to how p53 inhibition can result in cardioprotection during drug treatment and , paradoxically , enhanced D_D066126 long after the cessation of drug treatment .

title : C_D000157-induced C_D0021182+ overload causes D_D001145 and triggers apoptosis through p38 MAPK signaling pathway in rats . 
abstract : C_D000157 is a major bioactive diterpenoid alkaloid with high content derived from herbal aconitum plants . 
Emerging evidence indicates that voltage-dependent C_D012964 ( + ) channels have pivotal roles in the D_D066126 of C_D000157 . 
However , no reports are available on the role of C_D002118 ( 2+ ) in C_D000157 D_D011041 . 
In this study , we explored the importance of pathological C_D002118 ( 2+ ) signaling in C_D000157 D_D011041 in vitro and in vivo . 
We found that C_D002118 ( 2+ ) overload lead to accelerated beating rhythm in adult rat ventricular myocytes and caused D_D001145 in conscious freely moving rats . 
To investigate effects of C_D000157 on D_D009202 , we performed D_D064420 assay in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes ( NRVMs ) , as well as measured C_D019344 dehydrogenase level in the culture medium of NRVMs and activities of serum cardiac enzymes in rats . 
The results showed that C_D000157 resulted in D_D009202 and reduced NRVMs viability dose-dependently . 
To confirm the pro-apoptotic effects , we performed flow cytometric detection , cardiac histology , transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated C_-1-C_D001710 nick end labeling assay . 
The results showed that C_D000157 stimulated apoptosis time-dependently . 
The expression analysis of C_D002118 ( 2+ ) handling proteins demonstrated that C_D000157 promoted C_D002118 ( 2+ ) overload through the expression regulation of C_D002118 ( 2+ ) handling proteins . 
The expression analysis of apoptosis-related proteins revealed that pro-apoptotic protein expression was upregulated , and anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 expression was downregulated . 
Furthermore , increased phosphorylation of MAPK family members , especially the P-P38/P38 ratio was found in cardiac tissues . 
Hence , our results suggest that C_D000157 significantly aggravates C_D002118 ( 2+ ) overload and causes D_D001145 and finally promotes apoptotic development via phosphorylation of P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase .

title : Chronic treatment with C_D008687 suppresses toll-like receptor 4 signaling and attenuates D_D018487 following D_D009203 . 
abstract : Acute treatment with C_D008687 has a protective effect in D_D009203 by suppression of inflammatory responses due to activation of C_D000667-activated protein kinase ( C_D000667K ) . 
In the present study , the effect of chronic pre-treatment with C_D008687 on D_D006331 and toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) activities following D_D009203 and their relation with C_D000667K were assessed . 
Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of 5 groups ( n=6 ) : normal control and groups were injected C_D007545 after chronic pre-treatment with 0 , 25 , 50 , or 100mg/kg of C_D008687 twice daily for 14 days . 
C_D007545 ( 100mg/kg ) was injected subcutaneously on the 13th and 14th days to induce acute D_D009203 . 
C_D007545 alone decreased left ventricular systolic pressure and myocardial contractility indexed as LVdp/dtmax and LVdp/dtmin . 
The D_D018487 was significantly lower in the groups treated with 25 and 50mg/kg of C_D008687 . 
Metfromin markedly lowered C_D007545-induced elevation in the levels of TLR4 mRNA , myeloid differentiation protein 88 ( MyD88 ) , D_D009369 D_D009336 factor-alpha ( TNF-a ) , and interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) in the heart tissues . 
Similar changes were also seen in the serum levels of TNF-a and IL-6 . 
However , the lower doses of 25 and 50mg/kg were more effective than 100mg/kg . 
Phosphorylated C_D000667Ka ( p-C_D000667K ) in the myocardium was significantly elevated by 25mg/kg of C_D008687 , slightly by 50mg/kg , but not by 100mg/kg . 
Chronic pre-treatment with C_D008687 reduces post-D_D009203 D_D006331 and suppresses inflammatory responses , possibly through inhibition of TLR4 activities . 
This mechanism can be considered as a target to protect infarcted myocardium .

abstract : We herein describe the case of an 81-year-old Japanese woman with D_D009459 that occurred 36 days after the initiation of combination therapy with C_D063325 ( 75 mg/day ) and C_D013747 ( 12.5 mg/day ) for D_D006816 . 
The patient had been treated with C_D063325 or C_D013747 alone without any adverse effects before the administration of the combination therapy . 
She also had advanced D_D001943 when the combination therapy was initiated . 
To the best of our knowledge , the occurrence of D_D009459 due to combination therapy with C_D013747 and C_D063325 has not been previously reported . 
C_D013747 should be administered very carefully in combination with other C_D014150 , particularly in patients with a worsening general condition .

title : A C_D008790-C_C041359 combination induced D_D001919 . 
abstract : To report a sinus D_D001919 induced by C_D008790 and C_C041359 drug-drug interaction and its management . 
A 63 year-old Caucasian man on C_D008790 200 mg/day for stable D_D003324 was prescribed a 90-day course of oral C_C041359 250 mg/day for D_D014009 . 
On the 49th day of C_C041359 therapy , he was brought to the emergency room for a decrease of his global health status , D_D003221 and falls . 
The electrocardiogram revealed a 37 beats/min sinus D_D001919 . 
A score of 7 on the Naranjo D_D064420 probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the patient 's sinus D_D001919 and the drug interaction between C_D008790 and C_C041359 . 
The heart rate ameliorated first with a decrease in the dose of C_D008790 . 
It was subsequently changed to C_D017298 and the heart rate remained normal . 
By inhibiting the cytochrome P450 2D6 , C_C041359 had decreased C_D008790 's clearance , leading in C_D008790 accumulation which has resulted in clinically significant sinus D_D001919 .

title : C_D013739 ameliorates C_D013311-induced D_D008569 in male rats . 
abstract : AIM : To study the effects of C_D013739 on C_D013311 ( C_D013311 ) -induced D_D008569 in male rats . 
METHODS : Adult male Wistar rats were intracerebroventricularly ( icv ) infused with C_D013311 ( 750 ug ) on d 1 and d 3 , and a passive avoidance task was assessed 2 weeks after the first injection of C_D013311 . 
Castration surgery was performed in another group of rats , and the passive avoidance task was assessed 4 weeks after the operation . 
C_D013739 ( 1 mg.kg ( -1 ) .d ( -1 ) , sc ) , the C_D000728 receptor antagonist C_D005485 ( 10 mg.kg ( -1 ) .d ( -1 ) , ip ) , the C_D004967 receptor antagonist C_D013629 ( 1 mg.kg ( -1 ) .d ( -1 ) , ip ) or the aromatase inhibitor C_C067431 ( 4 mg.kg ( -1 ) .d ( -1 ) , ip ) were administered for 6 d after the first injection of C_D013311 . 
RESULTS : C_D013311 administration and castration markedly decreased both STL1 ( the short memory ) and STL2 ( the long memory ) in passive avoidance tests . 
C_D013739 replacement almost restored the STL1 and STL2 in castrated rats , and significantly prolonged the STL1 and STL2 in C_D013311-treated rats . 
Administration of C_D005485 , C_C067431 or C_D013629 significantly D_D008569 in intact rats , and significantly attenuated the C_D013739 replacement in improving C_D013311- and castration-induced D_D008569 . 
CONCLUSION : C_D013739 administration ameliorates C_D013311- and castration-induced D_D008569 in male Wistar rats .

title : Behavioral and neurochemical studies in mice pretreated with C_C573355 in C_D010862-induced D_D012640 . 
abstract : C_C573355 ( C_C573355 ) isolated from hexanic fraction seed extract of species Platonia insignis Mart . 
It is widely used in folk medicine to treat D_D012871 in both humans and animals as well as the seed decoction has been used to treat D_D003967 and D_D007249 . 
However , there is no research on C_C573355 effects in the central nervous system of rodents . 
The present study aimed to evaluate the C_C573355 effects at doses of 25 , 50 or 75 mg/kg on D_D012640 parameters to determine their anticonvulsant activity and its effects on C_D000596 ( C_D005680 ( C_D005680 ) , C_D018698 , C_D001224 and C_D005978 ) levels as well as on acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) activity in mice hippocampus after D_D012640 . 
C_C573355 produced an increased latency to first D_D012640 , at doses 25mg/kg ( 20.12 + 2.20 min ) , 50mg/kg ( 20.95 + 2.21 min ) or 75 mg/kg ( 23.43 + 1.99 min ) when compared with seized mice . 
In addition , C_D005680 content of mice hippocampus treated with C_C57335575 plus P400 showed an increase of 46.90 % when compared with seized mice . 
In C_D001224 , C_D018698 and C_D018698 levels detected a decrease of 5.21 % , 13.55 % and 21.80 % , respectively in mice hippocampus treated with C_C57335575 plus P400 when compared with seized mice . 
Hippocampus mice treated with C_C57335575 plus P400 showed an increase in AChE activity ( 63.30 % ) when compared with seized mice . 
The results indicate that C_C573355 can exert anticonvulsant activity and reduce the frequency of installation of C_D010862-induced D_D013226 , as demonstrated by increase in latency to first D_D012640 and decrease in mortality rate of animals . 
In conclusion , our data suggest that C_C573355 may influence in epileptogenesis and promote anticonvulsant actions in C_D010862 model by modulating the C_D005680 and C_D018698 contents and of AChE activity in seized mice hippocampus . 
This compound may be useful to produce neuronal protection and it can be considered as an anticonvulsant agent .

title : Standard operating procedures for antibiotic therapy and the occurrence of D_D058186 : a prospective , clinical , non-interventional , observational study . 
abstract : INTRODUCTION : D_D058186 ( D_D058186 ) occurs in 7 % of hospitalized and 66 % of Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) patients . 
It increases mortality , hospital length of stay , and costs . 
The aim of this study was to investigate , whether there is an association between adherence to guidelines ( standard operating procedures ( SOP ) ) for potentially D_D007674 antibiotics and the occurrence of D_D058186 . 
METHODS : This study was carried out as a prospective , clinical , non-interventional , observational study . 
Data collection was performed over a total of 170 days in three ICUs at Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin . 
A total of 675 patients were included ; 163 of these had therapy with C_D014640 , C_D005839 , or C_D014031 ; were > 18 years ; and treated in the ICU for > 24 hours . 
Patients with an adherence to SOP > 70 % were classified into the high adherence group ( HAG ) and patients with an adherence of < 70 % into the low adherence group ( LAG ) . 
D_D058186 was defined according to RIFLE criteria . 
Adherence to SOPs was evaluated by retrospective expert audit . 
Development of D_D058186 was compared between groups with exact Chi2-test and multivariate logistic regression analysis ( two-sided P < 0.05 ) . 
RESULTS : LAG consisted of 75 patients ( 46 % ) versus 88 HAG patients ( 54 % ) . 
D_D058186 occurred significantly more often in LAG with 36 % versus 21 % in HAG ( P = 0.035 ) . 
Basic characteristics were comparable , except an increased rate of soft tissue D_D007239 in LAG . 
Multivariate analysis revealed an odds ratio of 2.5-fold for LAG to develop D_D058186 compared with HAG ( 95 % confidence interval 1.195 to 5.124 , P = 0.039 ) . 
CONCLUSION : Low adherence to SOPs for potentially D_D007674 antibiotics was associated with a higher occurrence of D_D058186 .

title : D_D012206 in a D_D006526 patient treated with C_C486464 and C_D019821 . 
abstract : A 46-year old man with a chronic D_D006526 received triple therapy with C_D012254 , C_C417083 and C_C486464 . 
The patient also received C_D019821 . 
One month after starting the antiviral therapy , the patient was admitted to the hospital because he developed D_D012206 . 
At admission C_D019821 and all antiviral drugs were discontinued because D_D064420 due to a drug-drug interaction was suspected . 
The C_D003401 kinase peaked at 62,246 IU/L and the patient was treated with intravenous normal saline . 
The patient 's renal function remained unaffected . 
Fourteen days after hospitalization , C_D003401 kinase level had returned to 230 IU/L and the patient was discharged . 
C_C486464 was considered the probable causative agent of an interaction with C_D019821 according to the Drug Interaction Probability Scale . 
The interaction is due to inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated C_D019821 clearance . 
C_D019821 plasma concentration increased 30 times in this patient and C_D019821 induced muscle D_D064420 is related to the concentration of the C_D019821 in blood . 
In conclusion , with this case we illustrate that C_C486464 as well as C_D019821s are susceptible to clinical relevant drug-drug interactions .

title : Combination of C_C400082 , C_D013792 , and C_D003907 ( VTD ) as a consolidation therapy after autologous stem cell transplantation for symptomatic D_D009101 in Japanese patients . 
abstract : Consolidation therapy for patients with D_D009101 ( D_D009101 ) has been widely adopted to improve treatment response following autologous stem cell transplantation . 
In this study , we retrospectively analyzed the safety and efficacy of combination regimen of C_C400082 , C_D013792 , and C_D003907 ( VTD ) as consolidation therapy in 24 Japanese patients with newly diagnosed D_D009101 . 
VTD consisted of C_C400082 at a dose of 1.3 mg/m ( 2 ) and C_D003907 at a dose of 40 mg/day on days 1 , 8 , 15 , and 22 of a 35-day cycle , with daily oral C_D013792 at a dose of 100 mg/day . 
Grade 3-4 D_D009503 and D_D013921 were documented in four and three patients ( 17 and 13 % ) , respectively , but drug dose reduction due to D_D006402 was not required in any case . 
D_D010523 was common ( 63 % ) , but severe grade 3-4 D_D010523 was not observed . 
Very good partial response or better response ( > VGPR ) rates before and after consolidation therapy were 54 and 79 % , respectively . 
Patients had a significant probability of improving from < VGPR before consolidation therapy to > VGPR after consolidation therapy ( p = 0.041 ) . 
The VTD regimen may be safe and effective as a consolidation therapy in the treatment of D_D009101 in Japanese population .

title : Conversion to C_D020123 ameliorates C_D016572-induced D_D007674 in the rat : focus on serum , urine , gene , and protein renal expression biomarkers . 
abstract : Protocols of conversion from C_D016572 ( C_D016572 ) to C_D020123 ( C_D020123 ) have been widely used in immunotherapy after transplantation to prevent C_D016572-induced D_D007674 , but the molecular mechanisms underlying these protocols remain nuclear . 
This study aimed to identify the molecular pathways and putative biomarkers of C_D016572-to-C_D020123 conversion in a rat model . 
Four animal groups ( n = 6 ) were tested during 9 weeks : control , C_D016572 , C_D020123 , and conversion ( C_D016572 for 3 weeks followed by C_D020123 for 6 weeks ) . 
Classical and emergent serum , urinary , and kidney tissue ( gene and protein expression ) markers were assessed . 
D_D007674 were analyzed in C_D006416 and C_D004801 , periodic acid-Schiff , and Masson 's trichrome stains . 
C_D020123-treated rats presented D_D011507 and NGAL ( serum and urinary ) as the best markers of D_D007674 . 
Short C_D016572 treatment presented slight or even absent D_D007674 and TGF-b , NF- kb , mTOR , PCNA , TP53 , KIM-1 , and CTGF as relevant gene and protein changes . 
Prolonged C_D016572 exposure aggravated D_D007674 , without clear changes on the traditional markers , but with changes in serums TGF- b and IL-7 , TBARs clearance , and kidney TGF-b and mTOR . 
Conversion to C_D020123 prevented C_D016572-induced D_D007674 evolution ( absent/mild grade lesions ) , while NGAL ( serum versus urine ) seems to be a feasible biomarker of C_D016572 replacement to C_D020123 .

title : Kinin B2 receptor deletion and blockage ameliorates C_D002945-induced D_D058186 . 
abstract : C_D002945 treatment has been adopted in some chemotherapies ; however , this drug can induce D_D058186 due its ability to negatively affect renal function , augment serum levels of C_D003404 and C_D014508 , increase the D_D007683 score and up-regulate cytokines ( e.g. , IL-1b and TNF-a ) . 
The kinin B2 receptor has been associated with the D_D007249 process , as well as the regulation of cytokine expression , and its deletion resulted in an improvement in the D_D003928 status . 
To examine the role of the kinin B2 receptor in C_D002945-induced D_D058186 , kinin B2 receptor knockout mice were challenged with C_D002945 . 
Additionally , WT mice were treated with a B2 receptor antagonist after C_D002945 administration . 
B2 receptor-deficient mice were less sensitive to this drug than the WT mice , as shown by reduced D_D015431 , better preservation of kidney function , down regulation of inflammatory cytokines and less D_D007683 . 
Moreover , treatment with the kinin B2 receptor antagonist effectively reduced the levels of serum C_D003404 and blood C_D014508 after C_D002945 administration . 
Thus , our data suggest that the kinin B2 receptor is involved in C_D002945-induced D_D058186 by mediating the D_D009336 process and the expression of inflammatory cytokines , thus resulting in declined renal function . 
These results highlight the kinin B2 receptor antagonist treatment in amelioration of D_D007674 induced by C_D002945 therapy .

title : Safety and efficacy of C_D005446 intravitreal implant ( 0.59 mg ) in D_C537630 . 
abstract : PURPOSE : To report the treatment outcomes of the C_D005446 intravitreal implant ( 0.59 mg ) in patients with D_C537630 whose disease is refractory or intolerant to conventional immunomodulatory therapy . 
METHODS : A retrospective case series involving 11 D_C537630 patients ( 11 eyes ) . 
Eleven patients ( 11 eyes ) underwent surgery for C_D005446 implant ( 0.59 mg ) . 
Treatment outcomes of interest were noted at baseline , before C_D005446 implant , and then at 6 months , 1 year , 2 years , 3 years , and beyond 3 years . 
Disease activity markers , including signs of ocular D_D007249 , evidence of D_D031300 , Swedish interactive threshold algorithm-short wavelength automated perimetry Humphrey visual field analysis , electroretinographic parameters , and optical coherence tomography were recorded . 
Data on occurrence of D_D002386 and D_D009798 were collected in all eyes . 
RESULTS : Intraocular D_D007249 was present in 54.5 , 9.9 , 11.1 , and 0 % of patients at baseline , 6 months , 1 year , 2 years , 3 years , and beyond 3 years after receiving the implant , respectively . 
Active D_D014657 was noted in 36.3 % patients at baseline and 0 % at 3 years of follow-up . 
More than 20 % ( 47.61-67.2 % ) reduction in central retinal thickness was noted in all patients with D_D008269 at 6 months , 1 year , 2 years , and 3 years postimplant . 
At baseline , 54.5 % patients were on immunomodulatory agents . 
This percentage decreased to 45.45 , 44.4 , and 14.28 % at 1 year , 2 years , and 3 years postimplant , respectively . 
Adverse events included D_D009798 ( 54.5 % ) and D_D002386 formation ( 100 % ) . 
CONCLUSION : The data suggest that C_D005446 implant ( 0.59 mg ) helps to control D_D007249 in otherwise treatment-refractory cases of D_C537630 . 
It is associated with significant side effects of D_D002386 and D_D009798 requiring treatment .

title : Optimal precurarizing dose of C_C061870 to decrease D_D005207 and D_D063806 following C_D013390 administration . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : C_D013390 commonly produces frequent adverse effects , including muscle D_D005207 and D_D063806 . 
The current study identified the optimal dose of C_C061870 to prevent C_D013390-induced D_D005207 and D_D063806 and evaluated the influence of C_C061870 on the speed of onset produced by C_D013390 . 
METHODS : This randomized , double-blinded study was conducted in 100 patients randomly allocated into five groups of 20 patients each . 
Patients were randomized to receive 0.02 , 0.03 , 0.04 , 0.05 and 0.06 mg/kg C_C061870 as a precurarizing dose . 
Neuromuscular monitoring after each precurarizing dose was recorded from the adductor pollicis muscle using acceleromyography with train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve . 
All patients received C_D013390 1.5 mg/kg at 2 minutes after the precurarization , and were assessed the incidence and severity of D_D005207s , while D_D063806 was assessed at 24 hours after surgery . 
RESULTS : The incidence and severity of visible muscle D_D005207 was significantly less with increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of C_C061870 ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Those of D_D063806 tend to decrease according to increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of C_C061870 , but there was no significance ( P = 0.072 ) . 
The onset time of C_D013390 was significantly longer with increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of C_C061870 ( P < 0.001 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : Precurarization with 0.04 mg/kg C_C061870 was the optimal dose considering the reduction in the incidence and severity of D_D005207 and D_D063806 with acceptable onset time , and the safe and effective precurarization .

title : Absence of PKC-alpha attenuates C_D008094-induced D_D018500 . 
abstract : C_D008094 , an effective antipsychotic , induces D_D018500 ( D_D018500 ) in 40 % of patients . 
The decreased capacity to concentrate urine is likely due to C_D008094 acutely disrupting the C_D000242 pathway and chronically reducing C_D014508 transporter ( UT-A1 ) and water channel ( AQP2 ) expression in the inner medulla . 
Targeting an alternative signaling pathway , such as PKC-mediated signaling , may be an effective method of treating C_D008094-induced D_D011141 . 
PKC-alpha null mice ( PKCa KO ) and strain-matched wild type ( WT ) controls were treated with C_D008094 for 0 , 3 or 5 days . 
WT mice had increased urine output and lowered urine osmolality after 3 and 5 days of treatment whereas PKCa KO mice had no change in urine output or concentration . 
Western blot analysis revealed that AQP2 expression in medullary tissues was lowered after 3 and 5 days in WT mice ; however , AQP2 was unchanged in PKCa KO . 
Similar results were observed with UT-A1 expression . 
Animals were also treated with C_D008094 for 6 weeks . 
C_D008094-treated WT mice had 19-fold increased urine output whereas treated PKCa KO animals had a 4-fold increase in output . 
AQP2 and UT-A1 expression was lowered in 6 week C_D008094-treated WT animals whereas in treated PKCa KO mice , AQP2 was only reduced by 2-fold and UT-A1 expression was unaffected . 
Urinary C_D012964 , C_D011188 and C_D002118 were elevated in C_D008094-fed WT but not in C_D008094-fed PKCa KO mice . 
Our data show that ablation of PKCa preserves AQP2 and UT-A1 protein expression and localization in C_D008094-induced D_D018500 , and prevents the development of the severe D_D011141 associated with C_D008094 therapy .

title : Is D_D004408 Going to be a Rare or a Common Side-effect of C_D017311 ? 
abstract : A very rare side-effect of C_D017311 is D_D004408 . 
A review of the literature produced only one case . 
We report a case about a female with essential D_D006973 on drug treatment with C_D017311 developed D_D012678 . 
Condition moderately improved on stoppage of the drug for 25 days . 
We conclude that C_D017311 can cause D_D004408 .

title : D_D012206 in association with C_D019821 and dosage increment in C_D017291 . 
abstract : C_D017291 is the most documented cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) inhibitor to cause an adverse interaction with C_D019821 . 
This particular case is of interest as D_D012206 only occurred after an increase in the dose of C_D017291 . 
The patient developed raised cardiac biomarkers without any obvious cardiac issues , a phenomenon that has been linked to D_D012206 previously . 
To date , there has been no reported effect of D_D012206 on the structure and function of cardiac muscle . 
Clinicians need to be aware of prescribing concomitant medications that increase the risk of D_D009135 or inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme . 
Our case suggests that troponin elevation could be associated with C_D019821 induced D_D012206 , which may warrant further studies .

title : Characterization of a novel BCHE `` silent '' allele : point mutation ( p.Val204Asp ) causes loss of activity and prolonged D_D001049 with C_D013390 . 
abstract : D_C537417 is characterized by prolonged D_D001049 after the use of muscle relaxants ( C_D013390 or C_C049430 ) in patients who have mutations in the BCHE gene . 
Here , we report a case of prolonged neuromuscular block after administration of C_D013390 leading to the discovery of a novel BCHE variant ( c.695T > A , p.Val204Asp ) . 
Inhibition studies , kinetic analysis and molecular dynamics were undertaken to understand how this mutation disrupts the catalytic triad and determines a `` silent '' phenotype . 
Low activity of patient plasma butyrylcholinesterase with C_D002092 ( C_D002092 ) and C_D001588 , and values of C_D003992 and C_D005459 numbers fit with heterozygous atypical silent genotype . 
Electrophoretic analysis of plasma BChE of the proband and his mother showed that patient has a reduced amount of tetrameric enzyme in plasma and that minor fast-moving BChE components : monomer , dimer , and monomer-albumin conjugate are missing . 
Kinetic analysis showed that the p.Val204Asp/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr BChE displays a pure Michaelian behavior with C_D002092 as the substrate . 
Both catalytic parameters Km = 265 uM for C_D002092 , two times higher than that of the atypical enzyme , and a low Vmax are consistent with the absence of activity against C_D013390 . 
Molecular dynamic ( MD ) simulations showed that the overall effect of the mutation p.Val204Asp is disruption of C_D006859 bonding between Gln223 and Glu441 , leading Ser198 and His438 to move away from each other with subsequent disruption of the catalytic triad functionality regardless of the type of substrate . 
MD also showed that the enzyme volume is increased , suggesting a pre-denaturation state . 
This fits with the reduced concentration of p.Ala204Asp/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr tetrameric enzyme in the plasma and non-detectable fast moving-bands on electrophoresis gels .

title : Delayed D_D000740 after treatment with injectable C_C039726 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo : a manageable issue . 
abstract : Cases of delayed hemolytic D_D000740 have been described after treatment with injectable C_C039726 , the current World Health Organization ( WHO ) -recommended first-line drug for the treatment of severe D_D008288 . 
A total of 350 patients ( 215 [ 61.4 % ] < 5 years of age and 135 [ 38.6 % ] > 5 years of age ) were followed-up after treatment with injectable C_C039726 for severe D_D008288 in hospitals and health centers of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . 
Complete series of hemoglobin ( Hb ) measurements were available for 201 patients . 
A decrease in Hb levels between 2 and 5 g/dL was detected in 23 ( 11.4 % ) patients during the follow-up period . 
For five patients , Hb levels decreased below 5 g/dL during at least one follow-up visit . 
All cases of delayed D_D000740 were clinically manageable and resolved within one month .

title : Regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and apoptotic pathways by C_D001622 attenuates C_D007545-induced acute D_D009202 in rats . 
abstract : The present study was designed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of C_D001622 on acute D_D017202 induced experimentally in rats focusing on regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) and apoptotic pathways as the potential mechanism underlying the drug effect . 
Male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with C_D001622 ( 100 , 200 , and 400 mg/kg ) orally for 40 days . 
Acute D_D017202 was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of C_D007545 ( 85 mg/kg ) , for two consecutive days . 
Serum cardiac marker enzyme , histopathological variables and expression of protein levels were analyzed . 
Oral administration of C_D001622 ( 200 and 400 mg/kg ) significantly reduced the level of cardiac marker enzyme in the serum and prevented left D_D020257 . 
Western blot analysis showed that C_D007545-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was maintained or further enhanced by C_D001622 treatment in myocardium . 
Furthermore , C_D001622 ( 200 and 400 mg/kg ) treatment increased the ventricular expression of Bcl-2 and reduced the level of Bax , therefore causing a significant increase in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax . 
The protective role of C_D001622 on D_D009202 was further confirmed by histopathological examination . 
In summary , our results showed that C_D001622 pretreatment attenuated C_D007545-induced acute D_D017202 via the regulation of STAT3 and apoptotic pathways .

title : C_C069541-induced D_D009503 in a D_D001714 patient with D_D006528 . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : C_C069541 is a dibenzothiazepine derivative , similar to C_D003024 , which has the highest risk of causing D_D006402 , especially D_D009503 . 
There are some case reports about this side effect of C_C069541 , but possible risk factors are seldom discussed and identified . 
A case of a patient with D_D006528 that developed D_D009503 after treatment with C_C069541 is described here . 
CASE REPORT : A 62-year-old Taiwanese widow with D_D001714 disorder was diagnosed with D_D006528 at age 60 . 
She developed D_D007970 after being treated with C_C069541 . 
After C_C069541 was discontinued , her white blood cell count returned to normal . 
CONCLUSIONS : Although D_D009503 is not a common side effect of C_C069541 , physicians should be cautious about its presentation and associated risk factors . 
D_D008107 may be one of the possible risk factors , and concomitant D_D005334 may be a diagnostic marker for adverse reaction to C_C069541 .

title : Lateral antebrachial cutaneous D_D009422 after C_D013256 injection at lateral epicondyle . 
abstract : BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : This report aimed to present a case of lateral antebrachial cutaneous D_D009422 ( LACNP ) that occurred after a C_D013256 injection in the lateral epicondyle to treat D_D013716 in a 40-year-old woman . 
MATERIAL AND METHOD : A 40-year-old woman presented with decreased sensation and D_D010292 over her right lateral forearm ; the D_D010292 had occurred after a C_D013256 injection in the right lateral epicondyle 3 months before . 
Her sensation of light touch and D_D010146 was diminished over the lateral side of the right forearm and wrist area . 
RESULTS : The sensory action potential amplitude of the right lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve ( LACN ) ( 6.2 uV ) was lower than that of the left ( 13.1 uV ) . 
The difference of amplitude between both sides was significant because there was more than a 50 % reduction . 
She was diagnosed with right LACNP ( mainly axonal involvement ) on the basis of the clinical manifestation and the electrodiagnostic findings . 
Her symptoms improved through physical therapy but persisted to some degree . 
CONCLUSION : This report describes the case of a woman with LACNP that developed after a C_D013256 injection for the treatment of D_D013716 . 
An electrodiagnostic study , including a nerve conduction study of the LACN , was helpful to diagnose right LACNP and to find the passage of the LACN on the lateral epicondyle .

title : C_D003474 prevents C_C030272-induced D_D007674 : relation to hemodynamic alterations , oxidative stress , mitochondrial C_D010100 consumption and activity of respiratory complex I. abstract : The potential protective effect of the dietary antioxidant C_D003474 ( 120 mg/Kg/day for 6 days ) against the D_D007674 induced by C_C030272 was evaluated . 
Tubular D_D011507 and oxidative stress were induced by a single injection of C_C030272 ( 400 mg/kg ) in rats . 
C_C030272-induced D_D007674 included increase in renal vascular resistance and in the urinary excretion of total protein , C_D005947 , C_D012964 , neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) and N-acetyl b-D-glucosaminidase ( NAG ) , upregulation of D_D007674 molecule ( KIM ) -1 , decrease in renal blood flow and claudin-2 expression besides of D_D009336 and apoptosis of tubular cells on 24 h. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring the oxidation of lipids and proteins and diminution in renal Nrf2 levels . 
Studies were also conducted in renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells and in mitochondria isolated from kidneys of all the experimental groups . 
C_C030272 induced cell damage and reactive C_D010100 species ( ROS ) production in LLC-PK1 cells in culture . 
In addition , C_C030272 treatment reduced C_D010100 consumption in C_D000244-stimulated mitochondria and diminished respiratory control index when using C_C030298/C_D018698 as substrate . 
The activities of both complex I and aconitase were also diminished . 
All the above-described alterations were prevented by C_D003474 . 
It is concluded that C_D003474 is able to attenuate in vivo C_C030272-induced D_D007674 and in vitro cell damage . 
The in vivo protection was associated to the prevention of oxidative stress and preservation of mitochondrial C_D010100 consumption and activity of respiratory complex I , and the in vitro protection was associated to the prevention of ROS production .

title : Incidence of solid D_D009369 among pesticide applicators exposed to the C_D010755 insecticide C_D003976 in the Agricultural Health Study : an updated analysis . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : C_D003976 , a common C_D010755 insecticide with genotoxic properties , was previously associated with D_D008175 in the Agricultural Health Study ( AHS ) cohort , but few other epidemiological studies have examined C_D003976-associated D_D009369 risk . 
We used updated C_D003976 exposure and D_D009369 incidence information to evaluate solid D_D009369 risk in the AHS . 
METHODS : Male pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina reported lifetime C_D003976 use at enrolment ( 1993-1997 ) and follow-up ( 1998-2005 ) ; D_D009369 incidence was assessed through 2010 ( North Carolina ) /2011 ( Iowa ) . 
Among applicators with usage information sufficient to evaluate exposure-response patterns , we used Poisson regression to estimate adjusted rate ratios ( RRs ) and 95 % CI for D_D009369 sites with > 10 exposed cases for both lifetime ( LT ) exposure days and intensity-weighted ( IW ) lifetime exposure days ( accounting for factors impacting exposure ) . 
RESULTS : We observed elevated D_D008175 risks ( N=283 ) among applicators with the greatest number of LT ( RR=1.60 ; 95 % CI 1.11 to 2.31 ; Ptrend=0.02 ) and IW days of C_D003976 use ( RR=1.41 ; 95 % CI 0.98 to 2.04 ; Ptrend=0.08 ) . 
Kidney D_D009369 ( N=94 ) risks were non-significantly elevated ( RRLT days=1.77 ; 95 % CI 0.90 to 3.51 ; Ptrend=0.09 ; RRIW days 1.37 ; 95 % CI 0.64 to 2.92 ; Ptrend=0.50 ) , as were risks for aggressive prostate D_D009369 ( N=656 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : Our updated evaluation of C_D003976 provides additional evidence of an association with D_D008175 risk . 
Newly identified links to kidney D_D009369 and associations with aggressive prostate D_D009369 require further evaluation .

title : Associations of C_D010126 and PM2.5 Concentrations With D_D010300 Among Participants in the Agricultural Health Study . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : This study describes associations of C_D010126 and fine C_D052638 with D_D010300 observed among farmers in North Carolina and Iowa . 
METHODS : We used logistic regression to determine the associations of these pollutants with self-reported , doctor-diagnosed D_D010300 . 
Daily predicted pollutant concentrations were used to derive surrogates of long-term exposure and link them to study participants ' geocoded addresses . 
RESULTS : We observed positive associations of D_D010300 with C_D010126 ( odds ratio = 1.39 ; 95 % CI : 0.98 to 1.98 ) and fine C_D052638 ( odds ratio = 1.34 ; 95 % CI : 0.93 to 1.93 ) in North Carolina but not in Iowa . 
CONCLUSIONS : The plausibility of an effect of ambient concentrations of these pollutants on D_D010300 risk is supported by experimental data demonstrating damage to dopaminergic neurons at relevant concentrations . 
Additional studies are needed to address uncertainties related to confounding and to examine temporal aspects of the associations we observed .

title : Low functional programming of renal AT2R mediates the developmental origin of D_D005921 in adult offspring induced by prenatal C_D002110 exposure . 
abstract : UNASSIGNED : Our previous study has indicated that prenatal C_D002110 exposure ( PCE ) could induce D_D005317 ( D_D005317 ) of offspring . 
Recent research suggested that D_D005317 is a risk factor for D_D005921 . 
However , whether PCE could induce D_D005921 and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown . 
This study aimed to demonstrate the induction to D_D005921 in adult offspring by PCE and its intrauterine programming mechanisms . 
A rat model of D_D005317 was established by PCE , male fetuses and adult offspring at the age of postnatal week 24 were euthanized . 
The results revealed that the adult offspring kidneys in the PCE group exhibited D_D005921 as well as D_D005355 , accompanied by elevated levels of serum C_D003404 and urine protein . 
Renal C_D000804 receptor type 2 ( AT2R ) gene expression in adult offspring was reduced by PCE , whereas the renal C_D000804 receptor type 1a ( AT1aR ) /AT2R expression ratio was increased . 
The fetal kidneys in the PCE group displayed an enlarged Bowman 's space and a shrunken glomerular tuft , accompanied by a reduced cortex width and an increase in the nephrogenic zone/cortical zone ratio . 
Observation by electronic microscope revealed structural damage of podocytes ; the reduced expression level of podocyte marker genes , nephrin and podocin , was also detected by q-PCR . 
Moreover , AT2R gene and protein expressions in fetal kidneys were inhibited by PCE , associated with the repression of the gene expression of glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) /C_D014443 kinase receptor ( c-Ret ) signaling pathway . 
These results demonstrated that PCE could induce D_D007674 as well as D_D005921 of adult offspring , and the low functional programming of renal AT2R might mediate the developmental origin of adult D_D005921 .

title : C_C031763 , D_D015464 and the t ( 9:22 ) translocation : A reality check . 
abstract : UNASSIGNED : Epidemiological studies of C_C031763 have suggest that exposures to humans are associated with D_D015464 ( D_D015464 ) . 
D_D015464 has a well-documented association with ionizing radiation , but reports of associations with chemical exposures have been questioned . 
Ionizing radiation is capable of inducing the requisite D_D015464-associated t ( 9:22 ) translocation ( D_D010677 ) in appropriate cells in vitro but , thus far , chemicals have not shown this capacity . 
We have proposed that C_C031763 metabolites be so tested as a reality check on the epidemiological reports . 
In order to conduct reliable testing in this regard , it is essential that a positive control for induction be available . 
We have used ionizing radiation to develop such a control . 
Results described here demonstrate that this agent does in fact induce pathogenic t ( 9:22 ) translocations in a human myeloid cell line in vitro , but does so at low frequencies . 
Conditions that will be required for studies of C_C031763 are discussed .

title : D_D009369 incidence and C_C051786 use in the Agricultural Health Study : An update . 
abstract : UNASSIGNED : C_C051786 , a widely used herbicide , is classified as a Group C carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency based on increased D_D008113 in female rats . 
Epidemiologic studies of the health effects of C_C051786 have been limited . 
The Agricultural Health Study ( AHS ) is a prospective cohort study including licensed private and commercial pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina enrolled 1993-1997 . 
We evaluated D_D009369 incidence through 2010/2011 ( NC/IA ) for 49,616 applicators , 53 % of whom reported ever using C_C051786 . 
We used Poisson regression to evaluate relations between two metrics of C_C051786 use ( lifetime days , intensity-weighted lifetime days ) and D_D009369 incidence . 
We saw no association between C_C051786 use and incidence of all D_D009369s combined ( n = 5,701 with a 5-year lag ) or most site-specific D_D009369s . 
For liver D_D009369 , in analyses restricted to exposed workers , elevations observed at higher categories of use were not statistically significant . 
However , trends for both lifetime and intensity-weighted lifetime days of C_C051786 use were positive and statistically significant with an unexposed reference group . 
A similar pattern was observed for D_D008224 , but no other D_D008223 subtypes . 
An earlier suggestion of increased lung D_D009369 risk at high levels of C_C051786 use in this cohort was not confirmed in this update . 
This suggestion of an association between C_C051786 and liver D_D009369 among pesticide applicators is a novel finding and echoes observation of increased D_D008113 in some animal studies . 
However , our findings for both liver D_D009369 and D_D008224 warrant follow-up to better differentiate effects of C_C051786 use from other factors .

title : Mechanisms Underlying Latent Disease Risk Associated with Early-Life C_D001151 Exposure : Current Research Trends and Scientific Gaps . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Millions of individuals worldwide , particularly those living in rural and developing areas , are exposed to harmful levels of C_D001152 ( C_D001152 ) in their drinking water . 
C_D001152 exposure during key developmental periods is associated with a variety of adverse health effects including those that are evident in adulthood . 
There is considerable interest in identifying the molecular mechanisms that relate early-life C_D001152 exposure to the development of these latent diseases , particularly in relationship to D_D009369 . 
OBJECTIVES : This work summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of D_D009369 development in adulthood that is associated with early-life C_D001152 exposure . 
DISCUSSION : Epigenetic reprogramming that imparts functional changes in gene expression , the development of D_D009369 stem cells , and immunomodulation are plausible underlying mechanisms by which early-life C_D001152 exposure elicits latent carcinogenic effects . 
CONCLUSIONS : Evidence is mounting that relates early-life C_D001152 exposure and D_D009369 development later in life . 
Future research should include animal studies that address mechanistic hypotheses and studies of human populations that integrate early-life exposure , molecular alterations , and latent disease outcomes .

title : On the antiarrhythmic activity of one N-substituted C_C034930 derivative of C_-1 . 
abstract : The antiarrhythmic activity of the compound N- ( trans-3-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl ) -N- ( 3-oxo-3-phenyl-2-methylpropyl ) -C_C034930 hydrochloride , referred to as C_C013741 , is studied on anaesthesized cats and Wistar albino rats , as well as on non-anaesthesized rabbits . 
Four types of experimental D_D001145 are used -- with C_C024986 , with C_D002725-C_D004837 , with C_D010042 and with C_D000157 . 
The compound C_C013741 is introduced in doses of 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg intravenously and 10 mg/kg orally . 
The compound manifests antiarrhythmic activity in all models of experimental D_D001145 used , causing greatest inhibition on the D_D001145 induced by C_D002725-C_D004837 ( in 90 per cent ) and with C_C024986 ( in 84 per cent ) . 
The results obtained are associated with the beta-adrenoblocking and with the membrane-stabilizing action of the compound .

title : Experimental progressive D_D009136 and its treatment with high doses anabolizing agents . 
abstract : We are still a long way from discovering an unequivocal pathogenetic interpretation of progressive D_D009136 in man . 
Noteworthy efforts have been made in the experimental field ; a recessive autosomic form found in the mouse seems to bear the closest resemblance to the human form from the genetic point of view . 
D_D009135 due to lack of C_D014810 and D_D009135 induced by certain viruses have much in common anatomically and pathologically with the human form . 
The authors induced D_D009136 in the rat by giving it a diet lacking in C_D014810 . 
The pharmacological characteristics of C_D014810 and the degenerative changes brought about by its deficiency , especially in the muscles , are illustrated . 
It is thus confirmed that the histological characteristics of D_D009135 rat muscle induced experimentally are extraordinarily similar to those of human D_D009135 as confirmed during biopsies performed at the Orthopaedic Traumatological Centre , Florence . 
The encouraging results obtained in various authoratative departments in D_D009135 patients by using anabolizing C_D013256 have encouraged the authors to investigate the beneficial effects of one anabolizing agent ( C_D008696 , C_-1 ) at high doses in rats rendered D_D009135 by a diet deficient in C_D014810 . 
In this way they obtained appreciable changes in body weight ( increased from 50 to 70 g after forty days at a dose of 5 mg per day of anabolizing agent ) , but most of all they found histological changes due to `` regenerative '' changes in the muscle tissue , which however maintained its D_D009135 characteristics in the control animals that were not treated with the anabolizing agent . 
The authors conclude by affirming the undoubted efficacy of the anabolizing C_D013256 in experimental D_D009135 disease , but they have reservations as to the transfer of the results into the human field , where high dosage can not be carried out continuously because of the effects of the drug on virility ; because the tissue injury too often occurs at an irreversible stage vis-a-vis the `` regeneration '' of the muscle tissue ; and finally because the dystrophic injurious agent is certainly not the lack of C_D014810 but something as yet unknown .

title : Fetal risks due to C_D014859 therapy during pregnancy . 
abstract : Two mothers with heart valve prosthesis were treated with C_D014859 during pregnancy . 
In the first case a caesarean section was done one week after replacement of C_D014859 with C_D006493 . 
The baby died of cerebral and pulmonary hemorrhage . 
The second mother had a male infant by caesarean section . 
The baby showed C_D014859-induced D_D005315 with D_-1 and D_D002806 ( D_D002806 ) . 
D_-1 with or without D_D002806 has now been reported in 11 infants born to mothers treated with C_D014859 during the first trimester , and a causal association is probable . 
In view of the risks to both mother and fetus in women with prosthetic cardiac valves it is recommended that therapeutic abortion be advised as the first alternative .

title : C_D017275 treatment for D_D006973 in general practice in Hong Kong . 
abstract : A 6-week open study of the introduction of C_D017275 treatment was conducted in general practice in Hong Kong . 
303 Chinese patients with mild to moderate D_D006973 entered the study . 
Side effects were reported in 21 % of patients and caused withdrawal from the study in 3 patients . 
The main side-effects were D_D006261 , D_D004244 , D_-1 and D_D005483 and these were not more frequent than reported in other studies with C_D017275 or with placebo . 
Supine blood pressure was reduced ( P less than 0.01 ) from 170 +/- 20/102 +/- 6 mmHg to 153 +/- 19/92 +/- 8 , 147 +/- 18/88 +/- 7 and 144 +/- 14/87 +/- 6 mmHg at 2 , 4 and 6 weeks respectively in evaluable patients . 
Similar reductions occurred in standing blood pressure and there was no evidence of D_D007024 . 
Normalization and responder rates at 6 weeks were 86 % and 69 % respectively . 
Dosage was increased from 2.5 mg b.d . 
to 5 mg b.d . 
at 4 weeks in patients with diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg and their further response was greater than those remaining on 2.5 mg b.d .

title : Tachyphylaxis to systemic but not to airway responses during prolonged therapy with high dose inhaled C_D000420 in D_D001249 . 
abstract : High doses of inhaled C_D000420 produce substantial improvements in airway response in patients with D_D001249 , and are associated with dose-dependent systemic beta-adrenoceptor responses . 
The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether tachyphylaxis occurs during prolonged treatment with high dose inhaled C_D000420 . 
Twelve D_D001249tic patients ( FEV1 , 81 +/- 4 % predicted ) , requiring only occasional inhaled beta-agonists as their sole therapy , were given a 14-day treatment with high dose inhaled C_D000420 ( HDS ) , 4,000 micrograms daily , low dose inhaled C_D000420 ( LDS ) , 800 micrograms daily , or placebo ( PI ) by metered-dose inhaler in a double-blind , randomized crossover design . 
During the 14-day run-in and during washout periods , inhaled beta-agonists were withheld and C_D009241 was substituted for rescue purposes . 
At the end of each 14-day treatment , a dose-response curve ( DRC ) was performed , and airway ( FEV1 , FEF25-75 ) chronotropic ( HR ) , D_D014202 , and metabolic ( C_D011188 , C_D005947 ) responses were measured at each step ( from 100 to 4,000 micrograms ) . 
Treatment had no significant effect on baseline values . 
There were dose-dependent increases in FEV1 and FEF25-75 ( p less than 0.001 ) , and pretreatment with HDS did not displace the DRC to the right . 
DRC for HR ( p less than 0.001 ) , C_D011188 ( p less than 0.001 ) , and C_D005947 ( p less than 0.005 ) were attenuated after treatment with HDS compared with PI . 
There were also differences between HDS and LDS for HR ( p less than 0.001 ) and C_D005947 ( p less than 0.05 ) responses . 
Frequency and severity of subjective adverse effects were also reduced after HDS : D_D014202 ( p less than 0.001 ) , D_-1 ( p less than 0.001 ) .

title : Increased anxiogenic effects of C_D002110 in D_D016584 . 
abstract : The effects of oral administration of C_D002110 ( 10 mg/kg ) on behavioral ratings , somatic symptoms , blood pressure and plasma levels of C_D008734 ( C_D008734 ) and C_D006854 were determined in 17 healthy subjects and 21 patients meeting DSM-III criteria for D_D000379 with D_D016584 or D_D016584 . 
C_D002110 produced significantly greater increases in subject-rated D_D001008 , nervousness , fear , D_D009325 , D_-1 , D_D011595 , and D_D014202 in the patients compared with healthy subjects . 
In the patients , but not the healthy subjects , these symptoms were significantly correlated with plasma C_D002110 levels . 
Seventy-one percent of the patients reported that the behavioral effects of C_D002110 were similar to those experienced during D_D016584 . 
C_D002110 did not alter plasma C_D008734 levels in either the healthy subjects or patients . 
C_D002110 increased plasma C_D006854 levels equally in the patient and healthy groups . 
Because C_D002110 is an C_D000241 receptor antagonist , these results suggest that some D_D016584 patients may have D_D009421 involving C_D000241 . 
Patients with D_D001008 disorders may benefit by avoiding C_D002110-containing foods and beverages .

title : Human and canine ventricular vasoactive intestinal polypeptide : decrease with D_D006333 . 
abstract : Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) is a systemic and coronary vasodilator that may have positive inotropic properties . 
Myocardial levels of VIP were assayed before and after the development of D_D006333 in two canine models . 
In the first , C_D003035 D_D009202 was induced in eight dogs ; VIP ( by radioimmunoassay ) decreased from 35 +/- 11 pg/mg protein ( mean +/- SD ) to 5 +/- 4 pg/mg protein ( P less than 0.05 ) . 
In six dogs with C_D004317-induced D_D006333 , VIP decreased from 31 +/- 7 to 11 +/- 4 pg/mg protein ( P less than 0.05 ) . 
In addition , VIP content of left ventricular muscle of resected failing hearts in 10 patients receiving a heart transplant was compared with the papillary muscles in 14 patients ( five with D_D012216 , nine with D_-1 ) receiving mitral valve prostheses . 
The lowest myocardial VIP concentration was found in the hearts of patients with D_D003327 ( one patient receiving a transplant and three receiving mitral prostheses ) ( 6.3 +/- 1.9 pg/mg protein ) . 
The other patients undergoing transplantation had an average ejection fraction of 17 % +/- 6 % and a VIP level of 8.8 +/- 3.9 pg/mg protein . 
The hearts without D_D003324 ( average ejection fraction of this group 62 % +/- 10 % ) had a VIP concentration of 14.1 +/- 7.9 pg/mg protein , and this was greater than in hearts of the patients with D_D003327 and the hearts of patients receiving a transplant ( P less than 0.05 ) . 
Myocardial C_D002395 were also determined in 14 subjects ; a weak correlation ( r = 0.57 , P less than 0.05 ) between the tissue concentrations of VIP and C_D009638 was noted .

title : Interstrain variation in acute toxic response to C_D002110 among inbred mice . 
abstract : Acute toxic dosage-dependent behavioral effects of C_D002110 were compared in adult males from seven inbred mouse strains ( A/J , BALB/cJ , CBA/J , C3H/HeJ , C57BL/6J , DBA/2J , SWR/J ) . 
C57BL/6J , chosen as a `` prototypic '' mouse strain , was used to determine behavioral responses to a broad range ( 5-500 mg/kg ) of C_D002110 doses . 
Five phenotypic characteristics -- locomotor activity , righting ability , D_D012640 induction , stress-induced lethality , death without external stress -- were scored at various C_D002110 doses in drug-naive animals under empirically optimized , rigidly constant experimental conditions . 
Mice ( n = 12 for each point ) received single IP injections of a fixed volume/g body weight of physiological saline carrier with or without C_D002110 in doses ranging from 125-500 mg/kg . 
Loss of righting ability was scored at 1 , 3 , 5 min post dosing and at 5 min intervals thereafter for 20 min . 
In the same animals the occurrence of D_D012640s was scored as to time of onset and severity for 20 min after drug administration . 
When these proceeded to D_D012640 , death occurred in less than 20 min . 
Animals surviving for 20 min were immediately stressed by a swim test in 25 degrees C water , and death-producing D_D012640 were scored for 2 min . 
In other animals locomotor activity was measured 15 or 60 min after C_D002110 administration . 
By any single behavioral criterion or a combination of these criteria , marked differences in response to toxic C_D002110 doses were observed between strains . 
These results indicate that behavioral D_D064420 testing of C_-1 in a single mouse strain may be misleading and suggest that toxic responses of the central nervous system to this class of compounds are genetically influenced in mammals .

title : Invasive D_D010386 following C_D003520 therapy for nonmalignant disease . 
abstract : A 47-year-old woman with right D_D006869 due to ureterovesical junction obstruction had gross D_D006417 after being treated for five years wtih C_D003520 for D_D020293 . 
A right nephroureterectomy was required for control of D_D006470 . 
The pathology specimen contained clinically occult invasive D_D010386 . 
Although the ability of C_D003520 to cause hemorrhagic cystitis and urine cytologic abnormalities indistinguishable from high grade D_D002277 is well known , it is less widely appreciated that it is also associated with D_D002277 of the urinary tract . 
Twenty D_D002277s of the urinary bladder and one D_D002277 of the prostate have been reported in association with its use . 
The present case is the first D_D010386 reported in association with C_D003520 treatment . 
It is the third D_D014571 reported in association with C_D003520 treatment for nonmalignant disease . 
The association of the D_D009369 with preexisting D_D006869 suggests that stasis prolonged and intensified exposure of upper urinary tract epithelium to C_D003520 . 
Patients who are candidates for long-term C_D003520 treatment should be routinely evaluated for D_-1 .

title : Ascending dose tolerance study of intramuscular C_C020731 administered after normal vaginal birth . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : To determine the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of C_C020731 ( a long-acting synthetic analogue of C_D010121 ) , when administered immediately after vaginal delivery at term . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS : C_C020731 was given as an intramuscular injection immediately after the birth of the infant in 45 healthy women with normal singleton pregnancies who delivered vaginally at term . 
Dosage groups of 15 , 30 , 50 , 75 , 100 , 125 , 150 , 175 or 200 microg C_C020731 were assigned to blocks of three women according to the continual reassessment method ( CRM ) . 
RESULTS : All dosage groups consisted of three women , except those with 100 microg ( n=6 ) and 200 microg ( n=18 ) . 
Recorded were dose-limiting adverse events : D_D006973|D007022 ( three ) , severe D_D015746 ( 0 ) , D_D014839 ( 0 ) and D_D018457 ( four ) . 
Serious adverse events occurred in seven women : six cases with D_D006473 > or = 1000 ml , four cases of manual placenta removal , five cases of additional oxytocics administration and five cases of blood transfusion . 
Maximum D_D006473 was greatest at the upper and lower dose levels , and lowest in the 70-125 microg dose range . 
Four out of six cases with D_D006473 > or = 1000 ml occurred in the 200 microg group . 
The majority of additional administration of oxytocics ( 4/5 ) and blood transfusion ( 3/5 ) occurred in the dose groups of 200 microg . 
All D_D018457e were found in the group of 200 microg . 
CONCLUSION : The MTD was calculated to be at 200 microg C_C020731 .

title : A pilot study to assess the safety of C_D004280 stress echocardiography in the emergency department evaluation of C_D003042-associated D_D002637 . 
abstract : STUDY OBJECTIVE : D_D002637 in the setting of C_D003042 use poses a diagnostic dilemma . 
C_D004280 stress echocardiography ( DSE ) is a widely available and sensitive test for evaluating cardiac D_D007511 . 
Because of the theoretical concern regarding administration of C_D004280 in the setting of C_D003042 use , we conducted a pilot study to assess the safety of DSE in emergency department patients with C_D003042-associated D_D002637 . 
METHODS : A prospective case series was conducted in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit in the ED of an urban tertiary-care teaching hospital . 
Patients were eligible for DSE if they had used C_D003042 within 24 hours preceding the onset of D_D002637 and had a normal ECG and tropinin I level . 
Patients exhibiting signs of continuing C_D003042 D_D064420 were excluded from the study . 
All patients were admitted to the hospital for serial testing after the DSE testing in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit . 
RESULTS : Twenty-four patients were enrolled . 
Two patients had inadequate resting images , one DSE was terminated because of inferior D_D018476 , another DSE was terminated because of a rate-related atrial conduction deficit , and 1 patient did not reach the target heart rate . 
Thus , 19 patients completed a DSE and reached their target heart rates . 
None of the patients experienced signs of exaggerated adrenergic response , which was defined as a systolic blood pressure of greater than 200 mm Hg or the occurrence of D_-1 ( excluding D_D013616 ) . 
Further suggesting lack of exaggerated adrenergic response , 13 ( 65 % ) of 20 patients required supplemental C_D001285 to reach their target heart rates . 
CONCLUSION : No exaggerated adrenergic response was detected when C_D004280 was administered to patients with C_D003042-related D_D002637 .

title : C_D000638-induced D_D016171 during bladder irrigation : an unusual presentation -- a case report . 
abstract : The authors present a case of early ( within 4 days ) development of D_D016171 ( D_D016171 ) associated with oral C_D000638 therapy . 
Consistent with other reports this case of D_D016171 occurred in the context of multiple exacerbating factors including D_D007008 and C_D004077 excess . 
Transient prolongation of the QT during bladder irrigation prompted the episode of D_D016171 . 
It is well known that D_D001919 exacerbates acquired D_D016171 . 
The authors speculate that the increased vagal tone during bladder irrigation , a vagal maneuver , in the context of C_D000638 therapy resulted in C_D000638-induced D_-1 . 
In the absence of C_D000638 therapy , a second bladder irrigation did not induce D_D016171 despite D_D007008 and D_C537153 .

title : D_D058186 after high-dose C_D008558 in patients with D_C531616 during stem cell transplantation . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Patients with D_C531616 ( D_D000686 ) have a poor prognosis . 
Median survival time from standard treatments is only 17 months . 
High-dose intravenous C_D008558 followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( PBSCT ) appears to be the most promising therapy , but treatment mortality can be high . 
The authors have noted the development of D_D058186 immediately after C_D008558 conditioning . 
This study was undertaken to further examine its risk factors and impact on posttransplant mortality . 
METHODS : Consecutive D_D000686 patients who underwent PBSCT were studied retrospectively . 
D_D058186 ( D_D058186 ) after high-dose C_D008558 was defined by a minimum increase of 0.5 mg/dL ( 44 micromol/L ) in the serum C_D003404 level that is greater than 50 % of baseline immediately after conditioning . 
Urine sediment score was the sum of the individual types of sediment identified on urine microscopy . 
RESULTS : Of the 80 patients studied , D_D058186 developed in 18.8 % of the patients after high-dose C_D008558 . 
Univariate analysis identified age , D_D034141 , heavy D_D011507 , diuretic use , and urine sediment score ( > 3 ) as risk factors . 
Age and urine sediment score remained independently significant risk factors in the multivariate analysis . 
Patients who had D_D058186 after high-dose C_D008558 underwent dialysis more often ( P = 0.007 ) , and had a worse 1-year survival ( P = 0.03 ) . 
CONCLUSION : The timing of D_D058186 strongly suggests C_D008558 as the causative agent . 
Ongoing D_-1 may be a prerequisite for D_D058186 by C_D008558 as evidenced by the active urinary sediment . 
Development of D_D058186 adversely affected the outcome after PBSCT . 
Effective preventive measures may help decrease the treatment mortality of PBSCT in D_D000686 patients .

title : D_D001925 in regular recreational C_D003042 users . 
abstract : INTRODUCTION : The ability to read facial expressions is essential for normal human social interaction . 
The aim of the present study was to conduct the first investigation of facial expression recognition performance in recreational C_D003042 users . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Three groups , comprised of 21 C_D003042 naive participants ( CN ) , 30 occasional C_D003042 ( OC ) , and 48 regular recreational C_D003042 ( RC ) users , were compared . 
An emotional facial expression ( EFE ) task consisting of a male and female face expressing six basic emotions ( happiness , surprise , sadness , anger , fear , and disgust ) was administered . 
Mean percent accuracy and latencies for correct responses across eight presentations of each basic emotion were derived . 
Participants were also assessed with the `` Eyes task '' to investigate their ability to recognize more complex emotional states and the Symptom CheckList-90-Revised to measure psychopathology . 
RESULTS : There were no group differences in psychopathology or `` eyes task '' performance , but the RC group , who otherwise had similar illicit substance use histories to the OC group , exhibited D_D001925 accuracy compared to the OC and CN groups . 
The RC group also correctly identified anger , fear , happiness , and surprise , more slowly than CN , but not OC participants . 
The OC group was slower than CN when correctly identifying disgust . 
The selective D_D001925 accuracy manifested by the RC group can not be explained by the subacute effects of C_D003042 , or C_D018817 , because recent and less recent users of these drugs within this group were similarly impaired . 
Possible parallels between RC users and D_D001523 with respect to D_D001925 , D_-1 , and etiology are discussed .

title : D_D003320 associated with aerosolized C_D016578 use . 
abstract : PURPOSE : We report 4 cases of D_D003320 associated with D_D019966 . 
The pathogenesis of these D_D014456 and management of these patients are also reviewed . 
METHODS : Review of all cases of D_D003320 associated with D_D019966 seen at our institution from July 2006 to December 2006 . 
RESULTS : Four patients with D_D003320 associated with C_D016578 use were reviewed . 
All D_D003320 were cultured , and the patients were admitted to the hospital for intensive topical antibiotic treatment . 
Each patient received comprehensive health care , including medical and D_D019966 consultations . 
Streptococcal organisms were found in 3 cases and Capnocytophaga and Brevibacterium casei in 1 patient . 
The D_D007239 responded to antibiotic treatment . 
Two patients needed a lateral tarsorrhaphy for persistent D_-1 . 
CONCLUSIONS : Aerosolized C_D016578 use can be associated with the development of D_D003320 . 
D_D019966 provides additional challenges for management . 
Not only treatment of their D_D007239 but also the overall poor health of the patients and increased risk of noncompliance need to be addressed . 
Comprehensive care may provide the patient the opportunity to discontinue their D_D019966 , improve their overall health , and prevent future corneal complications .

title : C_C026098 as an adjunct to C_D010634 treatment in cats with suspected D_C562694 . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : To assess pharmacokinetics , efficacy , and tolerability of oral C_C026098 administered as an adjunct to C_D010634 treatment in cats with poorly controlled suspected D_C562694 . 
DESIGN-Open-label , noncomparative clinical trial . 
ANIMALS : 12 cats suspected to have D_C562694 that was poorly controlled with C_D010634 or that had unacceptable adverse effects when treated with C_D010634 . 
PROCEDURES : Cats were treated with C_C026098 ( 20 mg/kg [ 9.1 mg/lb ] , PO , q 8 h ) . 
After a minimum of 1 week of treatment , serum C_C026098 concentrations were measured before and 2 , 4 , and 6 hours after drug administration , and maximum and minimum serum concentrations and elimination half-life were calculated . 
D_D012640 frequencies before and after initiation of C_C026098 treatment were compared , and adverse effects were recorded . 
RESULTS : Median maximum serum C_C026098 concentration was 25.5 microg/mL , median minimum serum C_C026098 concentration was 8.3 microg/mL , and median elimination half-life was 2.9 hours . 
Median D_D012640 frequency prior to treatment with C_C026098 ( 2.1 D_D012640s/mo ) was significantly higher than median D_D012640 frequency after initiation of C_C026098 treatment ( 0.42 D_D012640s/mo ) , and 7 of 10 cats were classified as having responded to C_C026098 treatment ( ie , reduction in D_D012640 frequency of > or=50 % ) . 
Two cats had transient D_D053609 and D_-1 . 
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE : Results suggested that C_C026098 is well tolerated in cats and may be useful as an adjunct to C_D010634 treatment in cats with D_C562694 .

abstract : High-dose C_D008727 ( HD-C_D008727 ) is an important treatment for D_D002051 , but can cause hepatic and renal toxicity when its clearance is delayed . 
We report a case of D_D058186 after HD-C_D008727 therapy in a patient with ileostomy , The patient was a 3-year-old boy who had received a living-related liver transplantation for congenital D_D001656 . 
At day 833 after the transplantation , he was diagnosed with D_D008232 ( D_D008232 , D_D002051 ) . 
During induction therapy , he suffered ileal perforation and ileostomy was performed . 
Subsequent HD-C_D008727 therapy caused D_D058186 that required continuous hemodialysis . 
We supposed that intravascular D_D020896 due to substantial drainage from the ileostoma caused D_-1 . 
After recovery of his renal function , we could safely treat the patient with HD-C_D008727 therapy by controlling drainage from ileostoma with total parenteral nutrition .

abstract : BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : D_-1 ( D_-1 ) are potential risk factors for D_D002543 ( D_D002543 ) , but it is unclear if they are a contraindication to using antithrombotic drugs . 
Insights could be gained by pooling data on D_-1 frequency stratified by antithrombotic use in cohorts with D_D002543 and D_D002544 ( D_D002544 ) /D_D002546 ( D_D002546 ) . 
METHODS : We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished data from cohorts with D_D020521 or D_D002546 to compare the presence of D_-1 in : ( 1 ) antithrombotic users vs nonantithrombotic users with D_D002543 ; ( 2 ) antithrombotic users vs nonusers with D_D002544/D_D002546 ; and ( 3 ) D_D002543 vs D_D007511 events stratified by antithrombotic use . 
We also analyzed published and unpublished follow-up data to determine the risk of D_D002543 in antithrombotic users with D_-1 . 
RESULTS : In a pooled analysis of 1460 D_D002543 and 3817 D_D002544/D_D002546 , D_-1 were more frequent in D_D002543 vs D_D002544/D_D002546 in all treatment groups , but the excess increased from 2.8 ( odds ratio ; range , 2.3-3.5 ) in nonantithrombotic users to 5.7 ( range , 3.4-9.7 ) in antiplatelet users and 8.0 ( range , 3.5-17.8 ) in C_D014859 users ( P difference=0.01 ) . 
There was also an excess of D_-1 in C_D014859 users vs nonusers with D_D002543 ( OR , 2.7 ; 95 % CI , 1.6-4.4 ; P < 0.001 ) but none in C_D014859 users with D_D002544/D_D002546 ( OR , 1.3 ; 95 % CI , 0.9-1.7 ; P=0.33 ; P difference=0.01 ) . 
There was a smaller excess of D_-1 in antiplatelet users vs nonusers with D_D002543 ( OR , 1.7 ; 95 % CI , 1.3-2.3 ; P < 0.001 ) , but findings were similar for antiplatelet users with D_D002544/D_D002546 ( OR , 1.4 ; 95 % CI , 1.2-1.7 ; P < 0.001 ; P difference=0.25 ) . 
In pooled follow-up data for 768 antithrombotic users , presence of D_-1 at baseline was associated with a substantially increased risk of subsequent D_D002543 ( OR , 12.1 ; 95 % CI , 3.4-42.5 ; P < 0.001 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : The excess of D_-1 in C_D014859 users with D_D002543 compared to other groups suggests that D_-1 increase the risk of C_D014859-associated D_D002543 . 
Limited prospective data corroborate these findings , but larger prospective studies are urgently required .

title : C_D014700 stimulation test in D_D006966 : loss of prolactin response in anatomic or functional stalk effect . 
abstract : AIM : C_D014700 stimulation test was previously investigated as a tool for differential diagnosis of D_D006966 , but with conflicting results . 
D_D015175 was never considered in those previous studies . 
Here , we aimed to re-investigate the diagnostic value of C_D014700 in a population who were all screened for D_D015175 . 
Prolactin responses to C_D014700 in 65 female patients ( age : 29.9 +/- 8.1 years ) with D_D006966 were tested in a descriptive , matched case-control study . 
METHODS : C_D014700 80 mg , p.o . 
was administered , and then PRL levels were measured at 8th and 16th hours , by immunometric chemiluminescence . 
C_D014700 responsiveness was determined by peak percent change in basal prolactin levels ( PRL ) . 
RESULTS : C_D014700 significantly increased PRL levels in healthy controls ( N. 8 , PRL : 183 % ) , D_D015175 ( N. 8 , PRL : 7 % ) , D_D015175 ( N. 19 , PRL : 21 % ) , D_D015175 ( N. 23 , PRL : 126 % ) , but not in D_-1 ( N. 8 , PRL : 0.8 % ) , and C_D018967-induced D_D006966 ( N. 7 , PRL : 3 % ) . 
ROC curve analysis revealed that unresponsiveness to C_D014700 defined as PRL < 7 % , discriminated anatomical or functional stalk effect ( sensitivity : 74 % , specificity : 73 % , AUC : 0.855+/-0.04 , P < 0.001 , CI : 0.768-0.942 ) associated with D_-1 or C_D018967-induced D_D006966 , respectively . 
CONCLUSION : C_D014700 responsiveness is not a reliable finding for the differential diagnosis of D_D006966 . 
However , C_D014700 unresponsiveness discriminates stalk effect ( i.e. , anatomically or functionally inhibited dopaminergic tonus ) from other causes of D_D006966 with varying degrees of responsiveness .

title : Central action of narcotic analgesics . 
Part IV . 
Noradrenergic influences on the activity of analgesics in rats . 
abstract : The effect of C_D003000 , C_D009278 and C_C009695 on analgesia induced by C_D009020 , C_D003061 , C_D005283 and C_D010423 , and on D_D002375 effect of C_D009020 , C_D003061 and C_D005283 was studied in rats . 
The biochemical assays on the influence of four analgesics on the brain concentration and turnover of C_D009638 ( C_D009638 ) were also performed . 
It was found that three drugs stimulating central C_D009638 receptors failed to affect the analgesic ED50 of all antinociceptive agents and they enhanced D_D002375 induced by C_D009020 and C_D005283 . 
C_D003061 D_D002375 was increased by C_D003000 and decreased by C_D009278 and C_C009695 . 
The brain concentration of C_D009638 was not changed by C_D009020 and C_D005283 , but one of the doses of C_D003061 ( 45 mg/kg ) slightly enhanced it . 
C_D010423 dose-dependently decreased the brain level of C_D009638 . 
The rate of C_D009638 turnover was not altered by analgesics except for the higher dose of C_D005283 ( 0.2 mg/kg ) following which the disappearance of C_D009638 from the brain was diminished . 
The results are discussed in the light of various and non-uniform data from the literature . 
It is suggested that in rats the brain C_D009638 plays a less important function than the other C_D015306 in the behavioural activity of potent analgesics .

title : Modification by C_D011433 of cardiovascular effects of induced D_D007003 . 
abstract : The cardiovascular effects of D_D007003 , with and without beta-blockade , were compared in fourteen healthy men . 
Eight received insulin alone , and eight , including two of the original insulin-only group , were given C_D011433 and insulin . 
In the insulin-group the period of D_D007003 was associated with an increase in heart-rate and a fall in diastolic blood-pressure . 
In the C_D011433-insulin group there was a significant fall in heart-rate in most subjects and an increase in diastolic pressure . 
Typical S-T/T changes occurred in the insulin-group but in none of the C_D011433-insulin group . 
D_D006973 in D_D003920 prone to D_D007003 attacks should not be treated with beta-blockers because these drugs may cause a sharp rise in blood-pressure in such patients .

title : Prevention and treatment of D_D014591 in climacteric women receiving C_D004967 therapy . 
abstract : The treatment regimens are described in 74 patients with D_D014591 among 850 climacteric women receiving C_D004967 therapy . 
Cystic D_D006965 was associated with unopposed C_D004967 therapy without C_D011372 . 
Two courses of 21 days of 5 mg C_D009640 daily caused reversion to normal in all 57 cases of cystic D_D006965 and 6 of the 8 cases of atypical D_D006965 . 
4 cases of D_D016889 referred from elsewhere demonstrated the problems of inappropriate and unsupervised unopposed C_D004967 therapy and the difficulty in distinguishing severe D_D006965 from D_D009369 . 
Cyclical low-dose C_D004967 therapy with 7 -- 13 days of C_D011372 does not seem to increase the risk of endometrial D_D006965 or D_D002277 .

title : D_D012010 , D_D003875 and D_D008206 in a patient taking C_D010672 . 
abstract : A patient taking C_D010672 for 3 weeks developed a generalized D_D005076 , D_D008206 and D_D012010 . 
After withdrawal of the pharmacon all symptoms disappeared spontaneously . 
D_D005076 is a well-known complication of C_D010672 treatment as is benign and malignant D_D008206 . 
D_D012010 associated with C_D010672 medication has been reported in 3 patients . 
The exact mechanism by which C_D010672 exerts its toxic effects is not known . 
In this patient the time relation between the ingestion of C_D010672 and the occurrence of the D_D005076 , D_D008206 and D_D012010 is very suggestive of a direct connection .

title : Continuous infusion C_D014031 combined with C_D002228 for D_D007239 in D_D009369 patients . 
abstract : The cure rate of D_D007239 in D_D009369 patients is adversely affected by D_D009503 ( less than 1,000/mm3 ) . 
In particular , patients with severe D_D009503 ( less than 100/mm3 ) have shown a poor response to antibiotics . 
To overcome the adverse effects of D_D009503 , C_D014031 was given by continuous infusion and combined with intermittent C_D002228 . 
C_D014031 was given to a total daily dose of 300 mg/m2 and C_D002228 was given at a dose of 5 gm every four hours . 
There were 125 infectious episodes in 116 D_D009369 patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy . 
The overall cure rate was 70 % . 
D_D011014 was the most common D_D007239 and 61 % of 59 episodes were cured . 
Gram-negative bacilli were the most common causative organisms and 69 % of these D_D007239 were cured . 
The most common pathogen was Klebsiella D_D011014 and this , together with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , accounted for 74 % of all gram-negative bacillary D_D007239 . 
Response was not influenced by the initial neutrophil count , with a 62 % cure rate for 39 episodes associated with severe D_D009503 . 
However , failure of the neutrophil count to increase during therapy adversely affected response . 
D_D053099 was the major side effect recognized , and it occurred in 11 % of episodes . 
Major D_D053099 ( serum C_D003404 greater than 2.5 mg/dl or BUN greater than 50 mg/dl ) occurred in only 2 % . 
D_D053099 was not related to duration of therapy or serum C_D014031 concentration . 
This antibiotic regimen showed both therapeutic efficacy and acceptable D_D007674 for these patients .

title : Recurrent D_D013345 associated with C_D000614 therapy and D_D007674 . 
Case report . 
abstract : Epsilon C_D000614 ( C_D015119 ) has been used to prevent rebleeding in patients with D_D013345 ( D_D013345 ) . 
Although this agent does decrease the frequency of rebleeding , several reports have described D_D013927 complications of C_D015119 therapy . 
These complications have included clinical deterioration and D_D020767 in patients with D_D013345 , arteriolar and capillary fibrin D_D013927 in patients with fibrinolytic syndromes treated with C_D015119 , or other D_D013923 . 
Since intravascular fibrin D_D013927 are often observed in patients with fibrinolytic disorders , C_D015119 should not be implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrin D_D013927 in patients with D_D004211 or other `` D_D004211 . '' 
This report describes subtotal D_D007238 of the kidney due to D_D007674 . 
This occlusion occurred after C_D015119 therapy in a patient with D_D013345 and histopathological documentation of recurrent D_D013345 . 
The corresponding clinical event was characterized by marked D_D006973 and abrupt neurological deterioration .

title : Long-term C_D011433 therapy in pregnancy : maternal and fetal outcome . 
abstract : C_D011433 , a beta-adrenergic blocking agent , has found an important position in the practice of medicine . 
Its use in pregnancy , however , is an open question as a number of detrimental side effects have been reported in the fetus and neonate . 
Ten patients and 12 pregnancies are reported where chronic C_D011433 has been administered . 
Five patients with serial pregnancies with and without C_D011433 therapy are also examined . 
Maternal , fetal , and neonatal complications are examined . 
An attempt is made to differentiate drug-related complications from maternal disease -- related complications . 
We conclude that previously reported D_D007003 , D_D006932 , D_D011086 , D_D001049 , and D_D001919 are not invariable and can not be statistically correlated with chronic C_D011433 therapy . 
D_D005317 , however , appears to be significant in both of our series .

title : Use of C_D011433 in the treatment of D_C544351 . 
abstract : Five patients with D_C544351 who had physiologic and biochemical evidence of severe autonomic dysfunction were included in the study . 
They all exhibited markedly reduced plasma C_D002395 and plasma renin activity in both recumbent and upright positions and had marked D_D004342 to the pressor effects of infused C_D009638 . 
Treatment with C_D011433 administered intravenously ( 1-5 mg ) produced increases in supine and upright blood pressure in 4 of the 5 individuals with rises ranging from 11/6 to 22/11 mmHg . 
Chronic oral administration of C_D011433 ( 40-160 mg/day ) also elevated the blood pressures of these individuals with increases in the order of 20-35/15-25 mmg being observed . 
In 1 patient , marked D_D006973 was induced by C_D011433 and the drug had to be withdrawn . 
It otherwise was well tolerated and no important side effects were observed . 
Treatment has been continued in 3 individuals for 6-13 months with persistence of the pressor effect , although there appears to have been some decrease in the degree of response with time . 
Hemodynamic measurements in 1 of the patients demonstrated an increase in total peripheral resistance and essentially no change in cardiac output following C_D011433 therapy . 
The studies suggest that C_D011433 is a useful drug in selected patients with severe D_C544351 .

title : Total intravenous anesthesia with C_D005045 . 
III . 
Some observations in adults . 
abstract : An investigation was undertaken to determine the dosage of C_D005045 required to maintain sleep in adults undergoing surgery under regional local anesthesia . 
Premedication of C_D003975 10 mg and C_D001285 0.5 mg was given , and sleep was induced and maintained by intermittent intravenous injections of C_D005045 0.1/mg/kg , given whenever the patient would open his eyes on request . 
A mean overall dose of C_D005045 17.4 microgram/kg/min . 
was required to maintain sleep , but great individual variation occurred , with older patients requiring less drug . 
The investigation was discontinued after 18 patients because of the frequency and intensity of side-effects , particularly D_D010146 and D_D009207 , which caused the technique to be abandoned in two cases . 
It is considered unlikely that C_D005045 will prove to be the hypnotic of choice for a totally intravenous anesthetic technique in adults because of the high incidence of D_D009207 after prolonged administration . 
In several patients uncontrollable muscle movements persisted for many minutes after complete recovery of consciousness .

title : A method for the measurement of D_D014202 , and a comparison of the effects of tocolytic beta-mimetics . 
abstract : A method permitting measurement of finger D_D014202 as a displacement-time curve is described , using a test system with simple amplitude calibration . 
The coordinates of the inversion points of the displacement-time curves were transferred through graphical input equipment to punched tape . 
By means of a computer program , periods and amplitudes of D_D014202 oscillations were calculated and classified . 
The event frequency for each class of periods and amplitudes was determined . 
The actions of C_D005280 , C_D012312 and placebo given to 10 healthy subjects by intravenous infusion in a double-blind crossover study were tested by this method . 
At therapeutic doses both substances raised the mean D_D014202 amplitude to about three times the control level . 
At the same time , the mean period within each class of amplitudes shortened by 10 -- 20 ms , whereas the mean periods calculated from all oscillations together did not change significantly . 
After the end of C_D005280 infusion , D_D014202 amplitudes decreased significantly faster than those following C_D012312 infusion .

In addition , nonimmunologic binding of normal and patient 's serum proteins to her own and C_D002512-coated normal red cells was demonstrated . 
Skin tests and in vitro lymphocyte stimulation revealed that the patient was sensitized to C_D002512 and also to C_D000667 .

title : Kaliuretic effect of C_D007980 treatment in D_D010300 patients . 
abstract : D_D007008 , sometimes severe , was observed in some C_D007980-treated D_D010300 patients . 
The influence of C_D007980 on the renal excretion of C_D011188 was studied in 3 patients with D_D007008 and in 5 normokalemic patients by determination of renal plasma flow , glomerular filtration rate , plasma concentration of C_D011188 and C_D012964 as well as urinary excretion of C_D011188 , C_D012964 and C_D000450 . 
C_D007980 intake was found to cause an increased excretion of C_D011188 , and sometimes also of C_D012964 , in the hypokalemic but not in the normokalemic patients . 
This effect on the renal function could be prohibited by the administration of a peripheral dopa decarbodylase inhibitor . 
It is not known why this effect occurred in some individuals but not in others , but our results indicate a correlation between C_D000450 production and this renal effect of C_D007980 .

title : C_D010672 D_D001927 as probable idiosyncratic reaction : case report . 
abstract : A case of C_D010672 ( C_D010672 ) D_D001927 with increasing D_D012640 and EEG and mental changes is described . 
Despite adequate oral dosage of C_D010672 ( 5 mg/kg/daily ) the plasma level was very low ( 2.8 microgramg/ml ) . 
The D_D001927 was probably an idiosyncratic and not toxic or allergic reaction . 
In fact the concentration of free C_D010672 was normal , the patient presented a retarded morbilliform D_D005076 during C_D010672 treatment , the protidogram was normal , and an intradermic C_D010672 injection had no local effect . 
The authors conclude that in a patient starting C_D010672 treatment an unexpected increase in D_D012640 , with EEG and mental changes occurring simultaneously , should alert the physician to the possible need for eliminating C_D010672 from the therapeutic regimen , even if plasma concentrations are low .

title : Effects of exercise on the severity of C_D007545-induced D_D009203 . 
abstract : The effect of exercise on the severity of C_D007545-induced D_D009203 was studied in male rats . 
Ninety-three rats were randomly divided into three groups . 
The exercise-C_D007545 ( E-1 ) and exercise control ( EC ) groups exercised daily for thirty days on a treadmill at 1 mph , 2 % grade while animals of the sedentary-C_D007545 ( S-I ) group remained sedentary . 
Eight animals were assigned to the sedentary control ( SC ) group which remained sedentary throughout the experimental period . 
Forty-eight hours after the final exercise period , S-I and E-I animals received a single subcutaneous injection of C_D007545 ( 250 mg/kg body weight ) . 
Animals of the S-I group exhibited significantly ( Pp less than 0.05 ) greater mortality from the effects of C_D007545 than animals of the E-I group . 
Serum CPK activity for E-I animals was significantly ( p less than 0.05 ) greater than for animals in the S-I and EC groups twenty hours following C_D007545 injection . 
No statistically significant differences were observed between the two C_D007545 treated groups for severity of the induced lesions , changes in heart weight , or heart weight to body weight ratios . 
The results indicated that exercise reduced the mortality associated with the effects of large dosages of C_D007545 but had little on the severity of the D_D007238 .

title : Effect of C_D005937 on basic antibiotic-induced D_D007674 in rats . 
abstract : D_D003681 rats regularly develop D_D058186 following single injection of C_D000617 antibiotics combined with dextran or of antibiotics only . 
Oral administration of C_C038936 protected rats against D_D051437 induced by C_D007612-dextran . 
The protective effect was prevalent among C_D005937 , and also to other C_D005937 , C_D006603 and C_-1 , although to a lesser degree , but not to a hexaaldose , C_D013402 , substances inthe C_D002952 cycle and other acidic compounds . 
C_D005937 were effective against D_D007674 induced by peptide antibiotics as well as various C_D000617 antibitocis . 
Dose-responses were observed in the protective effect of C_D005937 . 
With a C_D005937 of a fixed size of dose , approximately the same degree of protection was obtained against D_D007674s induced by different basic antibiotics despite large disparities in administration doses of different antibiotics . 
C_D005937 had the ability to prevent D_D007674 but not to cure it . 
Rats excreted acidic urine when they were spared from D_D007674 by C_D009005 . 
The reduction effect of C_D005937 against D_D007674 of basic antibiotics was discussed .

title : D_D010264 following intrathecal C_D008727 : report of a case and review of the literature . 
abstract : A patient who developed D_D010264 following the intrathecal instillation of C_D008727 is discribed . 
The ten previously reported cases of this unusual complication are reviewed . 
The following factors appear to predispose to the development of this complication : abnormal cerebrospinal dynamics related to the presence of D_D002493 , and epidural cerebrospinal leakage ; elevated cerebrospinal fluid C_D008727 concentration related to abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and to inappropriately high C_D008727 doses based on body surface area calculations in older children and adults ; the presence of D_D020258 preservatives in commercially available C_D008727 preparations and diluents ; and the use of C_D008727 diluents of unphysiologic pH , ionic content and osmolarity . 
The role of C_D008727 contaminants , local D_C536409 , and cranial irradiation in the pathogenesis of intrathecal C_D008727 D_D064420 is unclear . 
The incidence of D_D020258ity may be reduced by employing lower doses of C_D008727 in the presence of D_D002493 , in older children and adults , and in the presence of epidural leakage . 
Only preservative-free C_D008727 in Elliott 's B Solution at a concentration of not more than 1 mg/ml should be used for intrathecal administration . 
Periodic monitoring of cerebruspinal fluid C_D008727 levels may be predictive of the development of serious D_D020258ity .

title : Centrally mediated cardiovascular effects of intracisternal application of C_D002217 in anesthetized rats . 
abstract : The pressor response to the intracisternal ( i.c . ) 
injection of C_D002217 ( 1 mug ) in anesthetized rats was analyzed . 
This response was significantly reduced by the intravenous ( i.v . ) 
injection of C_D006145 ( 5 mg ) , C_D018738 ( 10 mg ) or C_D010646 ( 5 mg ) , and conversely , potentiated by i.v . 
C_D003891 ( 0.3 mg ) , while C_D011433 ( 0.5 mg ) i.v . 
selectively inhibited the D_D006973 and the D_D013610 following i.c . 
C_D002217 ( 1 mug ) . 
On the other hand , the pressor response to i.c . 
C_D002217 ( 1 mug ) was almost completely blocked by i.c . 
C_D001285 ( 3 mug ) or C_D018738 ( 500 mug ) , and significantly reduced by i.c . 
C_D002746 ( 50 mug ) but significantly potentiated by i.c . 
C_D003891 ( 30 mug ) . 
The pressor response to i.c . 
C_D002217 ( 1 mug ) remained unchanged after sectioning of the bilateral cervical vagal nerves but disappeared after sectioning of the spinal cord ( C7-C8 ) . 
From the above result it is suggested that the pressor response to i.c . 
C_D002217 ortral and peripheral adrenergic mechanisms , and that the sympathetic trunk is the main pathway .

title : D_D005234 induced by C_D013752 in the rat . 
Dose-response relationships and effect of sex . 
abstract : Dose-response relationships , biochemical mechanisms , and sex differences in the experimental D_D005234 induced by C_D013752 were studied in the intact rat and with the isolated perfused rat liver in vitro . 
In the intact male and female rat , no direct relationship was observed between dose of C_D013752 and hepatic accumulation of C_D014280 . 
With provision of adequate C_D019301 as a substrate for the isolated perfused liver , a direct relationship was observed between dose of C_D013752 and both accumulation of C_D014280 in the liver and D_D003866 of output of C_D014280 by livers from male and female rats . 
Marked differences were observed between female and male rats with regard to base line ( control ) hepatic concentration of C_D014280 and output of C_D014280 . 
Accumulation of hepatic C_D014280 , as a per cent of control values , in response to graded doses of C_D013752 , did not differ significantly between male , female and pregnant rat livers . 
However , livers from female , and especially pregnant female rats , were strikingly resistant to the effects of C_D013752 on D_D003866 of output of C_D014280 under these experimental conditions . 
These differences between the sexes could not be related to altered disposition of C_D013752 or altered uptake of C_D019301 . 
Depressed hepatic secretion of C_D014280 accounted only for 30 to 50 % of accumulated hepatic C_D014280 , indicating that additional mechanisms must be involved in the production of the C_D014280-rich D_D005234 in response to C_D013752 .

title : C_D011374 potentiation of C_D002045 arrhythmogenicity in C_D010424-anesthetized rats and beating rat heart cell cultures . 
abstract : The effects of C_D011374 treatment on C_D002045 arrhythmogenicity in beating rat heart myocyte cultures and on anesthetized rats were determined . 
After determining the C_D002045 AD50 ( the concentration of C_D002045 that caused 50 % of all beating rat heart myocyte cultures to become D_D001145 ) , we determined the effect of 1-hour C_D011374 C_D006851 exposure on myocyte contractile rhythm . 
Each concentration of C_D011374 ( 6.25 , 12.5 , 25 , and 50 micrograms/ml ) caused a significant and concentration-dependent reduction in the AD50 for C_D002045 . 
C_D004958 treatment also increased the arrhythmogenicity of C_D002045 in myocyte cultures , but was only one fourth as potent as C_D011374 . 
Neither C_D011374 nor C_D004958 effects on C_D002045 arrhythmogenicity were potentiated by C_D004837 . 
Chronic C_D011374 pretreatment ( 5 mg/kg/day for 21 days ) caused a significant increase in C_D002045 arrhythmogenicity in intact C_D010424-anesthetized rats . 
There was a significant decrease in the time to onset of D_D001145 as compared with control nonC_D011374-treated rats ( 6.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 30.8 +/- 2.5 min , mean +/- SE ) . 
The results of this study indicate that C_D011374 can potentiate C_D002045 arrhythmogenicity both in vivo and in vitro . 
Potentiation of C_D002045 D_D001145 in myocyte cultures suggests that this effect is at least partly mediated at the myocyte level .

title : D_D058186 occurring during intravenous C_D003676 therapy : recovery after haemodialysis . 
abstract : A patient with transfusion-dependent D_D013789 was undergoing home intravenous C_D003676 ( C_D003676 ) treatment by means of a totally implanted system because of his poor compliance with the nightly subcutaneous therapy . 
Due to an accidental malfunctioning of the infusion pump , the patient was inadvertently administered a toxic dosage of the drug which caused D_D051437 . 
Given the progressive deterioration of the symptoms and of the laboratory values , despite adequate medical treatment , a decision was made to introduce haemodialytical therapy in order to remove the drug and therapy reduce the D_D007674 . 
From the results obtained , haemodialysis can therefore be suggested as a useful therapy in rare cases of progressive D_D058186 caused by C_D003676 .

title : C_D014150-associated D_D006966 . 
Can it be treated with C_D001971 ? 
abstract : Six stable psychiatric outpatients with D_D006966 and D_D000568/D_D009839 associated with their C_D014150 were treated with C_D001971 . 
Daily dosages of 5-10 mg corrected the D_D006966 and restored menstruation in four of the six patients . 
One woman , however , developed worsened D_D011618 while taking C_D001971 , and it was discontinued . 
Thus , three of six patients had their menstrual irregularity successfully corrected with C_D001971 . 
This suggests that C_D001971 should be further evaluated as potential therapy for C_D014150-associated D_D006966 and D_D000568/D_D005687 .

title : C_D004976-induced D_D012640 and brain neurotransmitters in mice . 
abstract : Intracerebroventricular injection of C_D004976 ( 50 % D_D012640 dose ; 50 micrograms/mouse ) accelerated the synthesis/turnover of C_D012701 ( C_D012701 ) but suppressed the synthesis of C_D005680 and C_D000109 in mouse brain . 
These effects were completely antagonized by pretreatment with a C_D018698/C_D016202 antagonist , C_-1 . 
In C_D004976-induced D_D012640 , these neurotransmitter systems may be differentially modulated , probably through activation of glutaminergic neurons in the brain .

title : Pharmacology of C_D005680A receptor complex after the in vivo administration of the anxioselective and anticonvulsant C_D002243 derivative C_C062769 . 
abstract : In rodents , the effect of the C_D002243 derivative isopropyl-6- benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-C_D002243-3-carboxylate ( C_C062769 ) , a new ligand for C_D001569 receptors possessing anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties , was evaluated on the function of central C_D005680 ( C_D005680 ) A receptor complex , both in vitro and in vivo . 
Added in vitro to rat cortical membrane preparation , C_C062769 increased [ 3H ] C_D005680 binding , enhanced C_D009118-stimulated 36Cl- uptake and reduced the binding of C_C037476 ( C_C037476 ) . 
These effects were similar to those induced by C_D003975 , whereas the partial agonist C_C054626 ( tert-butyl- ( S ) -8-bromo-11,12,13,13a-tetrahydro-9-oxo-9H- imidazo [ 1,5-a ] -pyrrolo- [ 2,1-c ] [ 1,4 ] C_D001569-1-carboxylate ) showed very weak efficacy in these biochemical tests . 
After i.p . 
injection to rats , C_C062769 and C_D003975 decreased in a time-dependent and dose-related ( 0.25-20 mg/kg i.p . ) 
manner C_C037476 binding measured ex vivo in the cerebral cortex . 
Moreover , both drugs at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg antagonized completely the convulsant activity and the increase of C_C037476 binding induced by C_D007538 ( 350 mg/kg s.c. ) as well as the increase of C_C037476 binding induced by foot-shock stress . 
To better correlate the biochemical and the pharmacological effects , we studied the action of C_C062769 on C_C037476 binding , exploratory motility and on C_D007538-induced biochemical and pharmacological effects in mice . 
In these animals , C_C062769 produced a paralleled dose-dependent ( 0.05-1 mg/kg i.p . ) 
reduction of both motor behavior and cortical C_C037476 binding . 
Moreover , 0.05 mg/kg of this C_D002243 reduced markedly the increase of C_C037476 binding and the D_D012640 induced by C_D007538 ( 200 mg/kg s.c. ) .

title : D_D020820 induced by C_D002220 therapy . 
abstract : There are very few reports about D_D020820 as a side effect of treatment with psychopharmacologic agents . 
In this report we present four patients treated with a combination of different psychotropic drugs , in whom D_D020820 was triggered either by adding C_D002220 ( C_D002220 ) to a treatment regimen , or by increasing its dosage . 
Neither dosage nor serum levels of C_D002220 were in a higher range . 
We consider D_D020820 to be an easily overlooked sign of D_D020258 , which may occur even at low or moderate dosage levels , if certain drugs as C_D008094 or C_D003024 are used in combination with C_D002220 .

title : Pharmacodynamics of the D_D007022 effect of C_D007980 in D_D010300 patients . 
abstract : Blood pressure effects of i.v . 
C_D007980 were examined in D_D010300 patients with stable and fluctuating responses to C_D007980 . 
The magnitude of the D_D007022 effect of C_D007980 was concentration dependent and was fit to an Emax model in fluctuating responders . 
Stable responders demonstrated a small D_D007022 response . 
Baseline blood pressures were higher in fluctuating patients ; a higher baseline blood pressure correlated with greater D_D007022 effects . 
AntiD_D010300 effects of C_D007980 temporally correlated with blood pressure changes . 
C_D010649 , a large neutral C_D000596 ( LNAA ) competing with C_D007980 for transport across the blood-brain barrier , reduced the D_D007022 and antiD_D010300 effects of C_D007980 . 
We conclude that C_D007980 has a central D_D007022 action that parallels the motor effects in fluctuating patients . 
The D_D007022 effect appears to be related to the higher baseline blood pressure we observed in fluctuating patients relative to stable patients .

Nine days after her second cycle she presented with D_D053609 and D_D018908 associated with D_D007010 . 
Evaluation revealed the D_D007177 , which was attributed to the C_D014750 infusion . 
After normal serum C_D012964 levels returned , further C_D004317 and C_D003907 chemotherapy without C_D014750 did not produce this complication .

title : D_D006333 : to digitalise or not ? 
The view against . 
abstract : Despite extensive clinical experience the role of C_D004077 is still not well defined . 
In patients with D_D001281 C_D004077 is beneficial for ventricular rate control . 
For patients in sinus rhythm and D_D006333 the situation is less clear . 
C_D004077 has a narrow therapeutic : toxic ratio and concentrations are affected by a number of drugs . 
Also , C_D004077 has undesirable effects such as increasing peripheral resistance and myocardial demands , and causing D_D001145 . 
There is a paucity of data from well-designed trials . 
The trials that are available are generally small with limitations in design and these show variation in patient benefit . 
More convincing evidence is required showing that C_D004077 improves symptoms or exercise capacity . 
Furthermore , no trial has had sufficient power to evaluate mortality . 
Pooled analysis of the effects of other inotropic drugs shows an excess mortality and there is a possibility that C_D004077 may increase mortality after D_D009203 ( D_D009203 ) . 
C_D000809-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors should be used first as they are safer , do not require blood level monitoring , modify progression of disease , relieve symptoms , improve exercise tolerance and reduce mortality . 
Caution should be exercised in using C_D004077 until large mortality trials are completed showing either benefit or harm . 
Until then C_D004077 should be considered a third-line therapy .

abstract : C_D005473 , a selective C_D012701 reuptake inhibitor , is gaining increased acceptance in the treatment of adolescent D_D003866 . 
Generally safe and well tolerated by adults , C_D005473 has been reported to induce D_D001714 . 
The cases of five D_D003866 adolescents , 14-16 years of age , who developed D_D001714 during pharmacotherapy with C_D005473 , are reported here . 
Apparent risk factors for the development of D_D001714 or hypoD_D001714 during C_D005473 pharmacotherapy in this population were the combination of D_D001289 and affective instability ; major D_D003866 with D_D011618 features ; a family history of D_D019964 , especially D_D001714 ; and a diagnosis of D_D001714 .

title : C_D015248-C_D008148 therapy for primary D_D006951 . 
abstract : The specific aim of this retrospective , observational study was to assess safety and efficacy of long-term ( 21 months/patient ) , open-label , C_D015248-C_D008148 treatment in 80 patients with primary mixed D_D006949 ( 68 % of whom had D_D002340 ) . 
Because ideal lipid targets were not reached ( low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) C_D002784 less than 130 mg/dl , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) C_D002784 greater than 35 mg/dl , or total C_D002784/HDL C_D002784 less than 4.5 mg/dl ) with diet plus a single drug , C_D015248 ( 1.2 g/day ) -C_D008148 ( primarily 20 or 40 mg ) treatment was given . 
Follow-up visits were scheduled with 2-drug therapy every 6 to 8 weeks , an average of 10.3 visits per patient , with 741 batteries of 6 liver function tests and 714 C_D003401 phosphokinase levels measured . 
Only 1 of the 4,446 liver function tests ( 0.02 % ) , a gamma glutamyl transferase , was greater than or equal to 3 times the upper normal limit . 
Of the 714 C_D003401 phosphokinase levels , 9 % were high ; only 1 ( 0.1 % ) was greater than or equal to 3 times the upper normal limit . 
With 2-drug therapy , mean total C_D002784 decreased 22 % from 255 to 200 mg/dl , C_D014280 levels decreased 35 % from 236 to 154 mg/dl , LDL C_D002784 decreased 26 % from 176 to 131 mg/dl , and the total C_D002784/HDL C_D002784 ratio decreased 24 % from 7.1 to 5.4 , all p less than or equal to 0.0001 . 
D_D009220 , attributable to the drug combination and symptomatic enough to discontinue it , occurred in 3 % of patients , and in 1 % with concurrent high C_D003401 phosphokinase ( 769 U/liter ) ; no patients had D_D012206 or D_D009212 .

abstract : The case of an 11-year-old boy is reported who was known to have D_D005199 for 3 years and was treated with C_D000728s , C_D000305s and transfusions . 
Two weeks before his death he was readmitted because of aplastic crisis with D_D018805 and marked abnormalities in liver function and died of D_D001996 . 
At autopsy D_D010382 and multiple D_D008113 were found which histologically proved to be well-differentiated D_D006528 . 
This case contributes to the previous observations that non-metastasizing D_D008113 and D_D010382 can develop in patients with C_D000728- and C_D000305-treated D_D005199 .

title : Chronic lesion of rostral ventrolateral medulla in spontaneously D_D006973 rats . 
abstract : We studied the effects of chronic selective neuronal lesion of rostral ventrolateral medulla on mean arterial pressure , heart rate , and neurogenic tone in conscious , unrestrained spontaneously D_D006973 rats . 
The lesions were placed via bilateral microinjections of 30 nmol/200 nl C_D016202 . 
The restimulation of this area with C_D016202 15 days postlesion failed to produce a pressor response . 
One day postlesion , the resting mean arterial pressure was significantly decreased in lesioned rats when compared with sham rats ( 100 +/- 7 versus 173 +/- 4 mm Hg , p less than 0.05 ) . 
Fifteen days later , the lesioned group still showed values significantly lower than the sham group ( 150 +/- 6 versus 167 +/- 5 mm Hg , p less than 0.05 ) . 
No significant heart rate differences were observed between the sham and lesioned groups . 
The ganglionic blocker C_D014294 ( 5 mg/kg i.v . ) 
caused similar reductions in mean arterial pressure in both lesioned and sham groups . 
The C_D014294-induced D_D007022 was accompanied by a significant D_D001919 in lesioned rats ( -32 +/- 13 beats per minute ) but a D_D013610 in sham rats ( +33 +/- 12 beats per minute ) 1 day postlesion . 
Therefore , rostral ventrolateral medulla neurons appear to play a significant role in maintaining D_D006973 in conscious spontaneously D_D006973 rats . 
Spinal or suprabulbar structures could be responsible for the gradual recovery of the D_D006973 in the lesioned rats .

title : D_D001930 during C_D010862-induced D_D013226 in the rat : immunohistochemical study of neurons , astrocytes and serum-protein extravasation . 
abstract : The substantia nigra has a gating function controlling the spread of D_D004827 activity . 
Additionally , in models of prolonged D_D013226 the pars reticulata of substantia nigra ( SNR ) suffers from a massive lesion which may arise from a massive D_D008659 and hyperexcitation developing in the activated SNR . 
In this study , D_D013226 was induced by systemic injection of C_D010862 in rats . 
The neuropathology of SNR was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time-course of changes in neurons and astrocytes . 
Animals surviving 20 , 30 , 40 , 60 min , 2 , 3 , 6 hours , 1 , 2 , and 3 days after induction of D_D013226 were perfusion-fixed , and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of SNR . 
Nissl-staining and antibodies against the neuron-specific C_D002118-binding protein , parvalbumin , served to detect D_D009422 in SNR . 
Antibodies against the astroglia-specific cytoskeletal protein , glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) , and against the glial C_D002118-binding protein , S-100 protein , were used to assess the status of astrocytes . 
Immunohistochemical staining for serum-albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood-brain barrier disturbances and D_D001929 formation . 
Immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of GFAP-staining already at 30 min after induction of D_D012640 in an oval focus situated in the center of SNR while sparing medial and lateral aspects . 
At 1 h there was additional vacuolation in S-100 protein staining . 
By 2 hours , parvalbumin-staining changed in the central SNR indicating D_D009422 , and Nissl-staining visualized some neuronal distortion . 
Staining for serum-proteins occurred in a patchy manner throughout the forebrain during the first hours . 
By 6 h , D_D001929 covered the D_D001930 . 
By 24 h , glial and neuronal markers indicated a massive lesion in the center of SNR . 
By 48-72 h , astrocytes surrounding the lesion increased in size , and polymorphic phagocytotic cells invaded the damaged area . 
In a further group of animals surviving 1 to 5 days , conventional paraffin-sections confirmed the neuronal and glial D_D001930 . 
Additional pathology of similar quality was found in the globus pallidus . 
Since astrocytes were always damaged in parallel with neurons in SNR it is proposed that the anatomical and functional interrelationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly tight in SNR . 
Both cell elements may suffer in common from metabolic disturbance and D_D001480 as occur during massive D_D013226 .

title : Reduced D_D066126 of C_D004317 given in the form of C_C032976 conjugates : and experimental study in the rat . 
abstract : A rat model was used to evaluate the general acute D_D064420 and the late D_D066126 of 4 mg/kg C_D004317 ( C_D004317 ) given either as free drug or in the form of three C_C032976 ( C_C032976 ) copolymer conjugates . 
In these C_C032976 copolymers , C_D004317 was covalently bound via peptide linkages that were either non-biodegradable ( Gly-Gly ) or degradable by lysosomal proteinases ( C_C504380 ) . 
In addition , one biodegradable conjugate containing C_D005688 was used ; this residue was targeted to the liver . 
Over the first 3 weeks after the i.v . 
administration of free and polymer-bound C_D004317 , all animals showed a transient reduction in body weight . 
However , the maximal reduction in body weight seen in animals that received polymer-bound C_D004317 ( 4 mg/kg ) was significantly lower than that observed in those that received free C_D004317 ( 4 mg/kg ) or a mixture of the unmodified parent C_C032976 copolymer and free C_D004317 ( 4 mg/kg ; P less than 0.01 ) . 
Throughout the study ( 20 weeks ) , deaths related to D_D066126 were observed only in animals that received either free C_D004317 or the mixture of C_C032976 copolymer and free C_D004317 ; in these cases , histological investigations revealed marked changes in the heart that were consistent with C_D004317-induced D_D066126 . 
Sequential measurements of cardiac output in surviving animals that received either free C_D004317 or the mixture of C_C032976 copolymer and free C_D004317 showed a reduction of approximately 30 % in function beginning at the 4th week after drug administration . 
The heart rate in these animals was approximately 12 % lower than that measured in age-matched control rats ( P less than 0.05 ) . 
Animals that were given the C_C032976 copolymer conjugates containing C_D004317 exhibited no significant change in cardiac output throughout the study ( P less than 0.05 ) . 
In addition , no significant histological change was observed in the heart of animals that received C_D004317 in the form of C_C032976 copolymer conjugates and were killed at the end of the study . 
However , these animals had shown a significant increase in heart rate beginning at 8 weeks after drug administration ( P less than 0.01 ) .

title : Topical 0.025 % C_D002211 in chronic D_D051474 : efficacy , predictors of response and long-term course . 
abstract : In order to evaluate the efficacy , time-course of action and predictors of response to topical C_D002211 , 39 patients with chronic D_D051474 ( D_D051474 ) , median duration 24 months , were treated with 0.025 % C_D002211 cream for 8 weeks . 
During therapy the patients rated their D_D010146 on a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) and a verbal outcome scale . 
A follow-up investigation was performed 10-12 months after study onset on the patients who had improved . 
Nineteen patients ( 48.7 % ) substantially improved after the 8-week trial ; 5 ( 12.8 % ) discontinued therapy due to side-effects such as intolerable C_D002211-induced burning sensations ( 4 ) or D_D008413 ( 1 ) ; 15 ( 38.5 % ) reported no benefit . 
The decrease in VAS ratings was significant after 2 weeks of continuous application . 
Of the responders 72.2 % were still improved at the follow-up ; only one-third of them had continued application irregularly . 
Treatment effect was not dependent on patient 's age , duration or localization of D_D051474 ( trigeminal involvement was excluded ) , D_-1 or D_D010146 character . 
Treatment response was not correlated with the incidence , time-course or severity of C_D002211-induced burning . 
If confirmed in controlled trials , the long-term results of this open , non-randomized study might indicate that the analgesic effect of C_D002211 in D_D051474 is mediated by both interference with neuropeptide metabolism and morphological changes ( perhaps degeneration ) of nociceptive afferents .

title : C_D012701 reuptake inhibitors , D_D010259 , and the ventral basal ganglia . 
abstract : Antidepressants have previously been associated with D_D010259 reactions in psychiatric patients . 
Five cases of D_D010259 exacerbation with the C_D012701 reuptake inhibitors C_D005473 and C_D000639 are reported here . 
Elements common to these cases included a history of D_D010259 symptomatology and the concomitant occurrence of depressive and psychotic symptoms . 
Complicated D_D003866 ( including atypicality of course and symptomatology , chronicity , D_D011605 , bipolarity , and secondary onset in the course of a primary D_D011605 ) may present particular vulnerability to D_D010259 exacerbations associated with C_D012701 reuptake inhibitors . 
Although the pharmacology and neurobiology of D_D010259 remain cryptic , several mechanisms , including 5HT3 receptor-mediated C_D004298 release , beta-noradrenergic receptor downregulation , or GABAB receptor upregulation acting in the vicinity of the ventral basal ganglia ( possibly in lateral orbitofrontal or anterior cingulate circuits ) , might apply to this phenomenon . 
These cases call attention to possible D_D010259 exacerbations with C_D012701 reuptake blockers in select patients and raise neurobiological considerations regarding D_D010259 .

title : Five cases of D_D004660 during treatment of D_D008118 with C_D004049 . 
abstract : Five cases of D_D004660 following treatment with C_D004049 ( C_D004049 ) were observed in Congolese patients with Loa loa D_D005368 . 
Two cases had a fatal outcome and one resulted in severe sequelae . 
The notable fact was that this complication occurred in three patients hospitalized before treatment began , with whom particularly strict therapeutic precautions were taken , i.e. , initial dose less than 10 mg of C_D004049 , very gradual dose increases , and associated anti-allergic treatment . 
This type of drug-induced complication may not be that uncommon in highly endemic regions . 
It occurs primarily , but not exclusively , in subjects presenting with a high microfilarial load . 
The relationship between the occurrence of D_D004660 and the decrease in D_-1 is evident . 
The pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in the light of these observations and the few other comments on this subject published in the literature .

title : D_D003693 in an elderly woman possibly associated with administration of C_D016595 . 
abstract : C_D016595 has been associated with adverse reactions , including gastrointestinal symptoms , gynecologic problems , and D_D006261 . 
Changes in mental status , however , have not been reported . 
We present a case in which an 89-year-old woman in a long-term care facility became confused after the initiation of C_D016595 therapy . 
The patient 's change in mental status was first reported nine days after the initiation of therapy . 
Her D_D003693 significantly improved after C_D016595 was discontinued and her mental status returned to normal within a week . 
Because no other factors related to this patient changed significantly , the D_D003693 experienced by this patient possibly resulted from C_D016595 therapy .

title : Hepatocellular oxidant stress following intestinal D_D007511-D_D015427 . 
abstract : Reperfusion of D_D007511 intestine results in acute D_D017093 characterized by hepatocellular enzyme release into plasma , reduction in bile flow rate , and neutrophil sequestration within the liver . 
The pathophysiology underlying this acute D_D056486 is unknown . 
This study was undertaken to determine whether oxidants are associated with the D_D056486 and to determine the relative value of several indirect methods of assessing oxidant exposure in vivo . 
Rats were subjected to a standardized intestinal D_D007511-D_D015427 . 
Hepatic tissue was assayed for lipid peroxidation products and oxidized and reduced C_D005978 . 
There was no change in hepatic tissue total C_D005978 following intestinal D_D007511-D_D015427 . 
Oxidized C_D005978 ( C_D019803 ) increased significantly following 30 and 60 min of reperfusion . 
There was no increase in any of the products of lipid peroxidation associated with this injury . 
An increase in C_D019803 within hepatic tissue during intestinal reperfusion suggests exposure of hepatocytes to an oxidant stress . 
The lack of a significant increase in products of lipid peroxidation suggests that the oxidant stress is of insufficient magnitude to result in irreversible injury to hepatocyte cell membranes . 
These data also suggest that the measurement of tissue C_D019803 may be a more sensitive indicator of oxidant stress than measurement of products of lipid peroxidation .

title : C_D004155 prevents the haemodynamic changes of C_D002927 in ICU patients . 
abstract : C_D002927 , a C_D006632 2 ( H2 ) antagonist , produces a decrease in arterial pressure due to vasodilatation , especially in critically ill patients . 
This may be because C_D002927 acts as a C_D006632 agonist . 
We , therefore , investigated the effects of the C_D006632 1 ( H1 ) receptor antagonist , C_D004155 , on the haemodynamic changes observed after C_D002927 in ICU patients . 
Each patient was studied on two separate days . 
In a random fashion , they received C_D002927 200 mg iv on one day , and on the other , a pretreatment of C_D004155 40 mg iv with C_D002927 200 mg iv . 
In the non-pretreatment group , mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) decreased from 107.4 +/- 8.4 mmHg to 86.7 +/- 11.4 mmHg ( P less than 0.01 ) two minutes after C_D002927 . 
Also , systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) decreased during the eight-minute observation period ( P less than 0.01 ) . 
In contrast , in the pretreatment group , little haemodynamic change was seen . 
We conclude that an H1 antagonist may be useful in preventing D_D007022 caused by iv C_D002927 , since the vasodilating activity of C_D002927 is mediated , in part , through the H1 receptor .

title : Severe D_D011115 and motor loss after intrathecal C_D013852 combination chemotherapy : description of two cases . 
abstract : Two cases of severe delayed D_D020258 related to the administration of intrathecal ( IT ) combination chemotherapy including C_D013852 ( C_D013852 ) are presented . 
Both cases developed D_D056768 with motor predominance in the lower extremities 1 and 6 months after IT chemotherapy was administered . 
D_D020258 have been described with IT-C_D008727 , IT-C_D003561 and IT-C_D013852 . 
To our knowledge , however , D_D056768 following administration of these three agents has not been previously described . 
In spite of the fact that C_D013852 is a useful IT agent , its combination with C_D008727 , C_D003561 and radiotherapy could cause severe D_D020258 . 
This unexpected complication indicates the need for further toxicology research on IT-C_D013852 .

title : Effects of C_D019806 and C_D020110 on large epicardial and small coronary arteries in conscious dogs . 
abstract : The effects of i.v . 
bolus administration of C_D019806 ( 1-10 micrograms/kg ) and C_D020110 ( 3-100 micrograms/kg ) on large ( circumflex artery ) and small coronary arteries and on systemic hemodynamics were investigated in chronically instrumented conscious dogs and compared to those of C_D005996 ( 0.03-10 micrograms/kg ) . 
C_D005996 , up to 0.3 micrograms/kg , selectively increased circumflex artery diameter ( CxAD ) without simultaneously affecting any other cardiac or systemic hemodynamic parameter . 
In contrast , C_D019806 and C_D020110 at all doses and C_D005996 at doses higher than 0.3 micrograms/kg simultaneously and dose-dependently increased CxAD , coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased coronary vascular resistance and aortic pressure . 
C_D019806 was approximately 8- to 9.5-fold more potent than C_D020110 in increasing CxAD . 
Vasodilation of large and small coronary vessels and D_D007022 induced by C_D019806 and C_D020110 were not affected by prior combined beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade but drug-induced D_D013610 was abolished . 
When circumflex artery blood flow was maintained constant , the increases in CxAD induced by C_D019806 ( 10 micrograms/kg ) , C_D020110 ( 30 micrograms/kg ) and C_D005996 ( 10 micrograms/kg ) were reduced by 68 +/- 7 , 54 +/- 9 and 1 +/- 1 % , respectively . 
Thus , whereas C_D005996 preferentially and flow-independently dilates large coronary arteries , C_D019806 and C_D020110 dilate both large and small coronary arteries and this effect is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors-mediated rise in myocardial metabolic demand . 
Finally , two mechanisms at least , direct vasodilation and flow dependency , are involved in the C_D019806- and C_D020110-induced increase in CxAD .

The D_D009503 was due to maturation arrest of the myeloid series in one patient . 
Both patients were also D_D007037 , but it is not clear whether this was a predisposing factor to the development of these adverse reactions . 
However , it would seem prudent not to use C_D008528 in D_D007037 patients until the D_D007037 has been corrected .

title : Etiology of D_D006934 in hemodialysis patients on C_D002119 therapy . 
abstract : Fourteen of 39 dialysis patients ( 36 % ) became D_D006934 after switching to C_D002119 as their principal C_D010710 binder . 
In order to identify risk factors associated with the development of D_D006934 , indirect parameters of intestinal C_D002118 reabsorption and bone turnover rate in these 14 patients were compared with results in 14 eucalcemic patients matched for age , sex , length of time on dialysis , and etiology of D_D007674 . 
In addition to experiencing D_D006934 episodes with peak C_D002118 values of 2.7 to 3.8 mmol/L ( 10.7 to 15.0 mg/dL ) , patients in the D_D006934 group exhibited a significant increase in the mean C_D002118 concentration obtained during 6 months before the switch , compared with the mean value obtained during the 7 months of observation after the switch ( 2.4 +/- 0.03 to 2.5 +/- 0.03 mmol/L [ 9.7 +/- 0.2 to 10.2 +/- 0.1 mg/dL ] , P = 0.006 ) . 
In contrast , eucalcemic patients exhibited no change in mean C_D002118 values over the same time period ( 2.3 +/- 0.05 to 2.3 +/- 0.05 mmol/L [ 9.2 +/- 0.2 to 9.2 +/- 0.2 mg/dL ] ) . 
C_D002119 dosage , calculated dietary C_D002118 intake , and circulating levels of C_D014807 metabolites were similar in both groups . 
Physical activity index and predialysis serum C_D001639 levels also were similar in both groups . 
However , there was a significant difference in parameters reflecting bone turnover rates between groups .

title : C_D008750-induced D_D000743 in a 15 year old presenting as near-D_D013575 . 
abstract : C_D008750 is an antihypertensive medication which is available generically and under the trade name C_D008750 that is widely prescribed in the adult population and infrequently used in children . 
C_D008750 causes an autoimmune D_D000743 in a small percentage of patients who take the drug . 
We report a case of C_D008750-induced D_D000743 in a 15-year-old boy who presented to the D_D004630 with near-D_D013575 . 
The boy had been treated with intravenous C_D008750 during a D_D014947 admission seven weeks prior to presentation . 
Evaluation revealed a hemoglobin of three grams , 3+ Coombs ' test with polyspecific anti-human globulin and monospecific IgG reagents , and a warm reacting autoantibody . 
Transfusion and C_D000305 therapy resulted in a complete recovery of the patient . 
Emergency physicians treating children must be aware of this syndrome in order to diagnose and treat it correctly . 
A brief review of autoimmune and drug-induced D_D000743s is provided .

title : The long-term safety of C_D003613 in women with D_D054179 . 
abstract : Although the short-term safety ( less than or equal to 6 months ) of C_D003613 has been established in a variety of settings , no information exists as to its long-term safety . 
We therefore investigated the long-term safety of C_D003613 by performing a retrospective chart review of 60 female patients with D_D054179 treated with C_D003613 for a continuous period of 6 months or longer . 
The mean age of the patients was 35.2 years and the mean duration of therapy was 59.7 months . 
Virtually all patients experienced one or more adverse reactions . 
D_D008599 ( 79 % ) , D_D015430 ( 60 % ) , D_D009120/D_D063806 ( 40 % ) , and transaminase elevations ( 40 % ) were the most common adverse reactions . 
The drug was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8 patients . 
No patient has died or suffered any apparent long-term sequelae that were directly attributable to the drug . 
We conclude that , despite a relatively high incidence of adverse reactions , C_D003613 has proven to be remarkably safe over the long-term in this group of patients .

title : Patient tolerance study of topical C_C048279 : a new topical agent for D_D002056 . 
abstract : Effective topical antimicrobial agents decrease D_D007239 and mortality in D_D002056 patients . 
C_C048279 ( C_C048279 ) , a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent , has been evaluated as a topical D_D002056 wound dressing in cream form , but preliminary clinical trials reported that it was D_D010146ful upon application . 
This study compared various concentrations of C_C048279 to determine if a tolerable concentration could be identified with retention of antimicrobial efficacy . 
Twenty-nine D_D002056 patients , each with two similar D_D002056 which could be separately treated , were given pairs of treatments at successive 12-h intervals over a 3-day period . 
One D_D002056 site was treated with each of four different C_C048279 concentrations , from 0.25 per cent to 2 per cent , their vehicle , and 1 per cent C_D012837 ( C_D012837 ) cream , an antimicrobial agent frequently used for topical treatment of D_D002056 wounds . 
The other site was always treated with C_D012837 cream . 
There was a direct relationship between C_C048279 concentration and patients ' ratings of D_D010146 on an analogue scale . 
The 0.25 per cent C_C048279 cream was closest to C_D012837 in D_D010146 tolerance ; however , none of the treatments differed statistically from C_D012837 or from each other . 
In addition , ease of application of C_C048279 creams was less satisfactory than that of C_D012837 . 
It was concluded that formulations at or below 0.5 per cent C_C048279 may prove acceptable for wound care , but the vehicle system needs pharmaceutical improvement to render it more tolerable and easier to use .

title : Dose-dependent D_D020258 of high-dose C_D002066 in children : a clinical and pharmacological study . 
abstract : C_D002066 is known to be D_D020258 in animals and humans , but its acute D_D020258 remains poorly characterized in children . 
We report here a retrospective study of 123 children ( median age , 6.5 years ) receiving high-dose C_D002066 in combined chemotherapy before bone marrow transplantation for malignant solid D_D009369 , brain D_D009369 excluded . 
C_D002066 was given p.o. , every 6 hours for 16 doses over 4 days . 
Two total doses were consecutively used : 16 mg/kg , then 600 mg/m2 . 
The dose calculation on the basis of body surface area results in higher doses in young children than in older patients ( 16 to 28 mg/kg ) . 
Ninety-six patients were not given anticonvulsive prophylaxis ; 7 ( 7.5 % ) developed D_D012640 during the 4 days of the C_D002066 course or within 24 h after the last dosing . 
When the total C_D002066 dose was taken into account , there was a significant difference in terms of D_D020258 incidence among patients under 16 mg/kg ( 1 of 57 , 1.7 % ) and patients under 600 mg/m2 ( 6 of 39 , 15.4 % ) ( P less than 0.02 ) . 
Twenty-seven patients were given a 600-mg/m2 C_D002066 total dose with continuous i.v . 
infusion of C_D002998 ; none had any D_D009461 . 
C_D002066 levels were measured by a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry assay in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of 9 children without D_D002493 under 600 mg/m2 C_D002066 with C_D002998 : C_D002066 cerebrospinal fluid : plasma ratio was 1.39 . 
This was significantly different ( P less than 0.02 ) from the cerebrospinal fluid : plasma ratio previously defined in children receiving a 16-mg/kg total dose of C_D002066 . 
This study shows that C_D002066 D_D020258 is dose-dependent in children and efficiently prevented by C_D002998 . 
A C_D002066 dose calculated on the basis of body surface area , resulting in higher doses in young children , was followed by increased D_D020258 , close to D_D020258 incidence observed in adults . 
Since plasma pharmacokinetic studies showed a faster C_D002066 clearance in children than in adults , this new dose may approximate more closely the adult systemic exposure obtained after the usual 16-mg/kg total dose , with potential inferences in terms of anticancer or myeloablative effects . 
The C_D002066 dose in children and infants undergoing bone marrow transplantation should be reconsidered on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies .

title : C_D006632 antagonists and C_D014403-induced D_D007022 in cardiac surgical patients . 
abstract : Hemodynamic effects and C_D006632 release by bolus injection of 0.35 mg/kg of C_D014403 were studied in 24 patients . 
H1- and H2-C_D006632 antagonists or placebo were given before dosing with C_D014403 in a randomized double-blind fashion to four groups : group 1 -- placebo ; group 2 -- C_D002927 , 4 mg/kg , plus placebo ; group 3 -- C_D002744 , 0.1 mg/kg , plus placebo ; and group 4 -- C_D002927 plus C_D002744 . 
C_D006632 release occurred in most patients , the highest level 2 minutes after C_D014403 dosing . 
Group 1 had a moderate negative correlation between plasma C_D006632 change and systemic vascular resistance ( r = 0.58 ; P less than 0.05 ) not present in group 4 . 
Prior dosing with antagonists partially prevented the fall in systemic vascular resistance . 
These data demonstrate that the hemodynamic changes associated with C_D014403 dosing are only partially explained by C_D006632 release . 
Thus prior dosing with H1- and H2-antagonists provides only partial protection .

title : Convulsant effect of C_D001556 and regional brain concentration of C_D005680 and C_D004298 . 
abstract : C_D001556 ( C_D001556 ) is an organochlorine insecticide with known D_D020258 effects . 
Its mechanism of action is not well understood although it has been proposed that C_D001556 acts as a non-competitive antagonist at the C_D005680 ( C_D005680 ) -A receptor . 
We studied the effect of C_D001556 ( 150 mg/kg ) on the C_D005680ergic and C_D004298rgic systems by measuring the concentration of C_D005680 , C_D004298 and its metabolites in 7 brain areas at the onset of D_D012640 . 
All animals suffered tonic D_D012640 at 18.3 +/- 1.4 min after C_D001556 administration . 
The concentration of C_D005680 was only slightly but significantly decreased in the colliculi without modifications in the other areas . 
The concentration of C_D004298 was increased in the mesencephalon and that of its metabolite C_D015102 was also increased in the mesencephalon and the striatum .

The literature related to antithyroid drug side effects and the mechanisms for their occurrence are reviewed and the efficacy and complications of thyroidectomy and radioiodine compared to those of antithyroid drugs . 
It is concluded that in most circumstances 131I is the therapy of choice for D_D006980 .

title : Anticonvulsant actions of C_D016291 on the C_D008094-C_D010862 model of D_D013226 in rats . 
abstract : C_D016291 , a noncompetitive C_D016202 ( C_D016202 ) receptor antagonist , was tested for anticonvulsant effects in rats using two D_D012640 models , coadministration of C_D008094 and C_D010862 and administration of a high dose of C_D010862 alone . 
Three major results are reported . 
First , pretreatment with C_D016291 produced an effective and dose-dependent anticonvulsant action with the C_D008094-C_D010862 model but not with rats treated with C_D010862 alone , suggesting that different biochemical mechanisms control D_D012640s in these two models . 
Second , the anticonvulsant effect of C_D016291 in the C_D008094-C_D010862 model only occurred after initial periods of D_D012640 activity . 
This observation is suggested to be an in vivo demonstration of the conclusion derived from in vitro experiments that C_D016291 binding requires agonist-induced opening of the channel sites of the C_D016202 receptor . 
Third , although it is relatively easy to block D_D012640s induced by C_D008094 and C_D010862 by administration of anticonvulsants prior to C_D010862 , it is more difficult to terminate ongoing D_D013226 and block the lethality of the D_D012640s . 
Administration of C_D016291 30 or 60 min after C_D010862 , i.e. , during D_D013226 , gradually reduced electrical and behavioral D_D012640 activity and greatly enhanced the survival rate . 
These results suggest that activation of C_D016202 receptors plays an important role in D_D013226 and D_D001930 in the C_D008094-C_D010862 model . 
This was further supported by results showing that nonconvulsive doses of C_D016202 and C_D010862 were synergistic , resulting in D_D013226 and subsequent mortality .

title : C_D009543 induced D_D001919 in a patient with D_D009422 . 
abstract : An 80 year old D_D003920 male with evidence of peripheral and D_D009422 was admitted with D_D002637 . 
He was found to have D_D001282 at a ventricular rate of 70/min which slowed down to 30-40/min when C_D009543 ( 60 mg ) in 3 divided doses , during which he was paced at a rate of 70/min . 
This is inconsistent with the well-established finding that C_D009543 induces D_D013610 in normally innervated hearts . 
However , in hearts deprived of compensatory sympathetic drive , it may lead to D_D001919 .

title : The effect of C_D006220 in C_D003042 and C_D000661 intoxication . 
abstract : The effectiveness of C_D006220 pretreatment in preventing the toxic effects of high doses of C_D000661 and C_D003042 was studied in rats . 
In this model , toxic effects were induced by intraperitoneal ( i.p . ) 
injection of C_D000661 75 mg/kg ( 100 % death rate ) or C_D003042 70 mg/kg ( 82 % death rate ) . 
C_D006220 failed to prevent C_D000661-induced D_D012640 , but did lower the mortality rate at most doses tested . 
C_D006220 decreased the incidence of C_D003042-induced D_D012640 at the two highest doses , but the lowering of the mortality rate did not reach statistical significance at any dose . 
These data suggest a protective role for the central C_D004298 blocker C_D006220 against death from high-dose C_D000661 exposure without reducing the incidence of D_D012640 . 
In contrast , C_D006220 demonstrated an ability to reduce C_D003042-induced D_D012640 without significantly reducing mortality .

abstract : C_D004967 binding sites were demonstrated by autoradiography in one transplantable and five primary C_D004054 induced D_D002292 in three hamsters . 
Radiolabelling , following the in vivo injection of 3H-17 beta C_D004958 , was increased only over the nuclei of D_D009369 cells ; stereologic analysis revealed a 4.5- to 6.7-times higher concentration of reduced C_D012834 grains over nuclei than cytoplasm of these cells . 
Despite rapid tubular excretion of C_D004958 which peaked in less than 1 h , the normal cells did not appear to bind the ligand . 
This is the first published report documenting the preferential in vivo binding of C_D004967 to nuclei of cells in C_D004967 induced hamster D_D002292 .

title : D_D001919 due to C_D001712 . 
abstract : In a 38-year-old male patient suffering from a severe D_D006562 D_D014277 , intravenous application of 10 mg C_D001712 lactate led to a long-lasting paradoxical reaction characterized by considerable D_D001919 , D_D004401 , and D_D003680 . 
The heart rate was back to normal within 12 hours upon administration of C_D009921 under cardiac monitoring in an intensive care unit . 
D_D001919 induced by C_D001712 is attributed to the speed of injection and to a dose-related dual effect of C_D001285-like drugs on C_D009116 receptors .

title : Deliberate D_D007022 induced by C_D007741 with C_D006221 , C_D004737 or C_D007530 for middle-ear surgery . 
abstract : The feasibility of using C_D007741 , an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent , as a D_D007022 agent in combination with inhalation anaesthetics ( C_D006221 , C_D004737 or C_D007530 ) was studied in 23 adult patients undergoing middle-ear surgery . 
The mean arterial pressure was decreased from 86 +/- 5 ( s.e . 
mean ) mmC_D006221g to 52 +/- 1 mmC_D006221g ( 11.5 +/- 0.7 to 6.9 +/- 0.1 kPa ) for 98 +/- 10 min in the C_D006221 ( C_D006221 ) group , from 79 +/- 5 to 53 +/- 1 mmC_D006221g ( 10.5 +/- 0.7 to 7.1 +/- 0.1 kPa ) for 129 +/- 11 min in the C_D004737 ( C_D004737 ) group , and from 80 +/- 4 to 49 +/- 1 mmC_D006221g ( 10.7 +/- 0.5 to 6.5 +/- 0.1 kPa ) for 135 +/- 15 min in the C_D007530 ( C_D007530 ) group . 
The mean C_D006221 concentration during D_D007022 in the inspiratory gas was 0.7 +/- 0.1 vol % , the mean C_D004737 concentration 1.6 +/- 0.2 vol % , and the mean C_D007530 concentration 1.0 +/- 0.1 vol % . 
C_D007530n addition , the patients received C_D005283 and C_D014403 . 
The initial dose of C_D007741 for lowering blood pressure was similar , 0.52-0.59 mg/kg , in all the groups . 
During D_D007022 , the heart rate was stable without D_D013610|D001919 . 
The operating conditions regarding D_D006470 were estimated in a double-blind manner , and did not differ significantly between the groups . 
During D_D007022 , the serum C_D003404 concentration rose significantly in all groups from the values before D_D007022 and returned postoperatively to the initial level in the other groups , except the C_D007530 group . 
After D_D007022 there was no rebound phenomenon in either blood pressure or heart rate . 
These results indicate that C_D007741 induces easily adjustable D_D007022 without compensatory D_D013610 and rebound D_D006973 .

title : Pharmacology of C_C043114 ( C_D010672 prodrug ) . 
abstract : C_C043114 , the C_-1 of C_C043104 , is a prodrug of C_D010672 with advantageous physicochemical properties . 
C_C043114 is rapidly converted enzymatically to C_D010672 in vivo . 
C_C043114 and C_D010672 sodium have equivalent anticonvulsant activity against D_D012640 induced by maximal electroshock ( MES ) in mice following i.p. , oral , or i.v . 
administration . 
The ED50 doses were 16 mg/kg for i.v . 
C_C043114 and 8 mg/kg for i.v . 
C_D010672 sodium . 
C_C043114 and C_D010672 sodium have similar antiarrhythmic activity against C_D010042-induced D_D017180 in anesthetized dogs . 
The total doses of C_C043114 or C_D010672 sodium necessary to convert the D_D001145 to a normal sinus rhythm were 24 +/- 6 and 14 +/- 3 mg/kg , respectively . 
Only C_D010672 sodium displayed in vitro antiarrhythmic activity against C_D013327-induced D_D001145s in guinea pig right atria . 
In anesthetized dogs , a high dose of C_C043114 ( 31 mg/kg ) was infused over 15 , 20 , and 30 min and the responses were compared to an equimolar dose of C_D010672 sodium ( 21 mg/kg ) . 
The C_C043114 and C_D010672 sodium treatments produced similar marked reductions in diastolic blood pressure and contractile force ( LVdP/dt ) . 
The maximum effects of each treatment occurred at the time of maximum C_D010672 sodium levels . 
Acute D_D064420 studies of C_C043114 and C_D010672 sodium were carried out in mice , rats , rabbits , and dogs by i.v. , i.m. , and i.p . 
routes of administration . 
The systemic toxic signs of both agents were similar and occurred at approximately equivalent doses . 
Importantly , the local irritation of C_C043114 was markedly less than C_D010672 sodium following i.m . 
administration .

title : Support for C_D004837-D_D006973 hypothesis : 18 hour pressor effect after 6 hours C_D004837 infusion . 
abstract : In a double blind , crossover study 6 h infusions of C_D004837 ( 15 ng/kg/min ; 1 ng = 5.458 pmol ) , norC_D004837 ( 30 ng/kg/min ; 1 ng = 5.911 pmol ) , and a 5 % C_D005947 solution ( 5.4 ml/h ) , were given to ten healthy volunteers in random order 2 weeks apart . 
By means of intra-arterial ambulatory monitoring the haemodynamic effects were followed for 18 h after the infusions were stopped . 
C_D004837 , but not norC_D004837 , caused a delayed and protracted pressor effect . 
Over the total postinfusion period systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were 6 ( SEM 2 ) % and 7 ( 2 ) % , respectively , higher than after C_D005947 infusion ( ANOVA , p less than 0.001 ) . 
Thus , `` stress '' levels of C_D004837 ( 230 pg/ml ) for 6 h cause a delayed and protracted pressor effect . 
These findings are strong support for the C_D004837-D_D006973 hypothesis in man .

title : Effect of C_-1 on C_D005839-induced D_D058186 in the rat . 
abstract : C_D000241 antagonists have been previously shown to be of benefit in some D_D007511 and D_D007674 models of D_D058186 ( D_D058186 ) . 
In the present study , the effects of three C_-1 with different potencies as C_D000241 antagonists C_C028322 , C_D013806 and C_C034347 , were examined in rats developing D_D058186 after 4 daily injections of C_D005839 ( 200 mg kg-1 ) . 
Renal function was assessed by biochemical ( plasma C_D014508 and C_D003404 ) , functional ( urine analysis and [ 3H ] inulin and [ 14C ] C_D010130 clearances ) and morphological ( degree of D_D009336 ) indices . 
The various drug treatments produced improvements in some , but not all , measurements of renal function . 
However , any improvement produced by drug treatment was largely a result of a beneficial effect exerted by its vehicle ( C_D011092 and C_D012972 ) . 
The lack of any consistent protective effect noted with the C_-1 tested in the present study indicates that C_D000241 plays little , if any , pathophysiological role in C_D005839-induced D_D058186 .

abstract : A total of 261 adverse ocular reactions occurred in 237 patients who received C_D015474 , a commonly used drug in the treatment of severe cystic D_D000152 . 
D_D003231 , subjective complaints of D_D014985 , D_D014786 , contact lens intolerance , and D_D010787 are reversible side effects . 
More serious ocular adverse reactions include D_D010211 , D_D011559 , and white or gray subepithelial D_D003318 ; all of these are reversible if the drug is discontinued . 
Reported cases of decreased dark adaptation are under investigation . 
C_D015474 is contraindicated in pregnancy because of the many reported D_D000013 after maternal use ( including D_D008850 , orbital D_D006972 , and D_C563492 ) .

Oral C_D017265 50 micrograms b.d. , C_D017265 100 micrograms b.d. , and C_D013726 5 mg t.i.d. , were compared when given randomly in 1-week treatment periods . 
The best clinical effect was found with C_D013726 . 
Both anti-D_D001249 and D_D014202 effects of C_D017265 were dose-related . 
C_D017265 appeared effective in the doses tested , and a twice daily regimen would appear to be suitable with this drug .

title : Subacute effects of C_D011433 and B 24/76 on C_D007545-induced rat D_D006332 in correlation with blood pressure . 
abstract : We compared the potential beta-receptor blocker , B 24/76 i.e . 
1- ( 2,4-dichlorophenoxy ) -3 [ 2-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl ) ethanolamino ] -prop an-2-ol , which is characterized by beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulating properties with C_D011433 . 
The studies were performed using an experimental model of C_D007545-induced D_D006332 in rats . 
A correlation of the blood pressure was neither found in the development nor in the attempt to suppress the development of D_D006332 with the two beta-receptor blockers . 
Both beta-blockers influenced the development of D_D006984 to a different , but not reproducible extent . 
It was possible to suppress the increased C_D009952 decarboxylase activity with both beta-blockers in D_D006332 , but there was no effect on the heart mass . 
Neither C_D011433 nor B 24/76 could stop the changes in the characteristic myosin isoenzyme pattern of the D_D006984 rat heart . 
Thus , the investigations did not provide any evidence that the beta-receptor blockers C_D011433 and B 24/76 have the potency to prevent C_D007545 from producing D_D006332 .

title : Comparison of the effect of C_C017590 and of slow-release C_D013806 on nocturnal D_D001249 . 
abstract : The effects of a new inhaled antimuscarinic drug , C_C017590 , and of a slow-release C_D013806 preparation upon nocturnal D_D001249 were compared in a placebo-controlled double-blind study . 
Two samples were studied : 12 patients received C_C017590 at 600 micrograms ( 6 subjects ) or at 400 micrograms t.i.d . 
( 6 subjects ) whereas 11 received C_D013806 at 300 mg b.i.d . 
Morning dipping , assessed by the fall in peak flow overnight , was significantly reduced in the periods when either active drug was taken , whereas no difference was noticed during the placebo administration . 
No significant difference was noticed between results obtained with either active drug , as well as with either dosage of C_C017590 . 
No subject reported side effects of C_C017590 , as compared to three subjects reporting D_D009325 , D_D014839 and D_D014202 after C_D013806 . 
C_C017590 proves to be a valuable alternative to C_D013806 in nocturnal D_D001249 , since it is equally potent , safer and does not require the titration of dosage .

title : Reversible C_D014635-induced D_D003704 : a case report . 
abstract : Reversible C_D014635-induced D_D003704 was documented in a 21-year-old man with D_D004827 who had a 3-year history of insidious progressive decline in global cognitive abilities documented by serial neuropsychological studies . 
Repeat neuropsychological testing 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug revealed dramatic improvement in IQ , memory , naming , and other tasks commensurate with clinical recovery in his intellectual capacity . 
Possible pathophysiological mechanisms which may have been operative in this case include : a direct central nervous system ( CNS ) toxic effect of C_D014635 ; a paradoxical epileptogenic effect secondary to the drug ; and an indirect CNS toxic effect mediated through C_D014635-induced D_D022124 .

title : Reversal of C_D012601-induced D_D000647 of passive avoidance by pre- and post-training C_D009270 . 
abstract : In a series of five experiments , the modulating role of C_D009270 on a C_D012601-induced D_D008569 in a passive avoidance paradigm was investigated in mice . 
C_D012601 , but not methyl C_D012601 ( 1 and 3 mg/kg ) , induced an D_D000647 as measured by latency and duration parameters . 
C_D009270 ( 0.3 , 1 , 3 , and 10 mg/kg ) injected prior to training attenuated the D_D008569 with a peak of activity at 3 mg/kg . 
The effect of C_D009270 could be antagonized with C_D009020 ( 1 , 3 , and 10 mg/kg ) , demonstrating the opioid specificity of the C_D009270 effect . 
Post-training administration of C_D009270 ( 3 mg/kg ) as a single or as a split dose also attenuated the C_D012601-induced D_D000647 . 
Control experiments indicated that neither an increase in D_D010146 sensitivity ( pre-training C_D009270 ) nor an induced aversive state ( post-training C_D009270 ) appear to be responsible for the influence of C_D009270 on the C_D012601-induced D_D008569 . 
These results extend previous findings implicating a cholinergic-opioid interaction in memory processes . 
A possible mechanism for this interaction involving the septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathway is discussed .

title : Electron microscopic investigations of the C_D003520-induced D_D001745 of the rat and their prevention by C_D015080 . 
abstract : Fully developed C_D003520-induced D_D003556 is characterized by nearly complete detachment of the urothelium , severe submucosal D_D004487 owing to damage to the microvascular bed and focal muscle D_D009336 . 
The initial response to the primary attack by the C_D003520 metabolites seems to be fragmentation of the C_D010634 membrane . 
This damages the cellular barrier against the hypertonic urine . 
Subsequent breaks in the lateral cell membranes of the superficial cells and in all the plasma membranes of the intermediate and basal cells , intercellular and intracellular D_D004487 and disintegration of the desmosomes and hemidesmosomes lead to progressive degeneration and detachment of the epithelial cells with exposure and splitting of the basal membrane . 
The morphological changes of the endothelial cells , which become more pronounced in the later stages of the experiment , the involvement of blood vessels regardless of their diameter and the location-dependent extent of the damage indicate a direct type of damage which is preceded by a mediator-induced increase in permeability , the morphological correlate of which is the formation of gaps in the interendothelial cell connections on the venules . 
These changes can be effectively prevented by C_D015080 . 
The only sign of a possible involvement is the increase in the number of specific granules with a presumed lysosomal function in the superficial cells .

title : Increase in intragastric pressure during C_D013390-induced D_D005207 in children : inhibition by C_D015760 . 
abstract : Changes in intragastric pressure after the administration of C_D013390 1.5 mg kg-1 i.v . 
were studied in 32 children ( mean age 6.9 yr ) pretreated with either physiological saline or C_D015760 50 micrograms kg-1 . 
Anaesthesia was induced with C_D013874 5 mg kg-1 . 
The incidence and intensity of D_D005207 caused by C_D013390 were significantly greater in the control than in the C_D015760 group . 
The intragastric pressure during D_D005207 was significantly higher in the control group ( 16 +/- 0.7 ( SEM ) cm C_D014867 ) than in the C_D015760 group ( 7.7 +/- 1.5 ( SEM ) cm C_D014867 ) . 
The increase in intragastric pressure was directly related to the intensity of D_D005207 ( regression line : y = 0.5 + 4.78x with r of 0.78 ) . 
It is concluded that intragastric pressure increases significantly during D_D005207 caused by C_D013390 in healthy children . 
C_D015760 50 micrograms kg-1 effectively inhibits the incidence and intensity of C_D013390-induced D_D005207 ; moreover , intragastric pressure remains at its control value .

title : Acute insulin treatment normalizes the resistance to the D_D066126 effect of C_D007545 in C_D013311 D_D003920 rats . 
A morphometric study of C_D007545 induced myocardial D_D005355 . 
abstract : The acute effect of insulin treatment on the earlier reported protective effect of C_D013311 D_D003920 against the D_D066126 effect of high doses of C_D007545 ( C_D007545 ) was investigated in rats . 
Thirty to 135 min after the injection of crystalline insulin , C_D007545 was given subcutaneously and when C_D007545 induced D_D005355 in the myocardium was morphometrically analyzed 7 days later , a highly significant correlation ( r = 0.83 , 2 p = 0.006 ) to the slope of the fall in blood C_D005947 after insulin treatment appeared . 
The myocardial content of C_D002395 was estimated in these 8 day D_D003920 rats . 
The C_D009638 content was significantly increased while C_D004837 remained unchanged . 
An enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity with a consequent down regulation of the myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors could , therefore , explain this C_D002395 resistance . 
The rapid reversion after insulin treatment excludes the possibility that C_D013311 in itself causes the C_D007545 resistance and points towards a direct insulin effect on myocardial C_D002395 sensitivity in D_D003920 rats . 
The phenomenon described might elucidate pathogenetic mechanisms behind toxic myocardial cell degeneration and may possibly have relevance for acute cardiovascular complications in D_D003920 patients .

title : Differential effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on D_D012640 produced by C_D010862 in rats . 
abstract : The muscarinic cholinergic agonist C_D010862 induces in rats D_D012640 and D_D013226 followed by widespread damage to the forebrain . 
The present study was designed to investigate the effect of 5 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , C_D012980 , C_D010653 , C_D007213 , C_D007052 and C_D008528 , on D_D012640 produced by C_D010862 . 
Pretreatment of rats with C_D012980 , ED50 103 mg/kg ( 60-174 ) , and C_D010653 , 59 mg/kg ( 50-70 ) converted the non-convulsant dose of C_D010862 , 200 mg/kg , to a convulsant one . 
C_D007213 , 1-10 mg/kg , and C_D007052 , 10-100 mg/kg , failed to modulate D_D012640 produced by C_D010862 . 
C_D008528 , 26 ( 22-30 ) mg/kg , prevented D_D012640 and protected rats from D_D012640-related D_D001930 induced by C_D010862 , 380 mg/kg . 
These results indicate that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs differentially modulate the threshold for C_D010862-induced D_D012640 .

title : D_D009422 after high-dose C_D005047 therapy for D_D005910 . 
abstract : C_D005047 ( C_D005047 ) has been used in the treatment of many solid D_D009369 and D_D019337 . 
When used in high doses and in conjunction with autologous bone marrow transplantation , this agent has activity against several treatment-resistant D_D009369 including D_D005910 . 
In six of eight patients ( 75 % ) who we treated for recurrent or resistant D_D005910 , sudden severe D_D009422 occurred . 
This developed a median of 9 days after initiation of high-dose C_D005047 therapy . 
Significant clinical manifestations have included D_D003221 , D_D010211 , D_D006970 , exacerbation of D_-1 , and sharp increase in D_D012640 activity . 
These abnormalities resolved rapidly after initiation of high-dose intravenous C_D003907 therapy . 
In all patients , computerized tomographic ( CT ) brain scans demonstrated stability in D_D009369 size and periD_D009369 D_D004487 when compared with pretransplant scans . 
This complication appears to represent a significant new D_D064420 of high-dose C_D005047 therapy for D_D005910 .

title : Progressive D_D001649 after C_D013827 administration . 
abstract : A 27-yr-old man developed D_D007565 2 wk after exposure to C_D013827 . 
D_D002779 persisted for 3 yr , at which time a liver transplant was performed . 
Two liver biopsy specimens and the hepatectomy specimen were remarkable for almost complete disappearance of interlobular bile ducts . 
Prominent D_D005355 and hepatocellular regeneration were also present ; however , the lobular architecture was preserved . 
This case represents an example of `` idiosyncratic '' D_D056486 in which the primary target of injury is the bile duct . 
An autoimmune pathogenesis of the D_D001649 is suggested .

title : Differential effects of C_C038806 C_D002121 : therapeutic implications . 
abstract : Increasing recognition of the importance of C_D002118 in the pathogenesis of D_D002318 has stimulated research into the use of C_D002118 channel blocking agents for treatment of a variety of D_D002318s . 
The favorable efficacy and tolerability profiles of these agents make them attractive therapeutic modalities . 
Clinical applications of C_D002121 parallel their tissue selectivity . 
In contrast to C_D014700 and C_D004110 , which are roughly equipotent in their actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle , the C_C038806 C_D002121 are a group of potent peripheral vasodilator agents that exert minimal electrophysiologic effects on cardiac nodal or conduction tissue . 
As the first C_C038806 available for use in the United States , C_D009543 controls D_D000787 and D_D006973 with minimal depression of cardiac function . 
Additional members of this group of C_D002121 have been studied for a variety of indications for which they may offer advantages over current therapy . 
Once or twice daily dosage possible with C_D009568 and C_D015737 offers a convenient administration schedule , which encourages patient compliance in long-term therapy of D_D006973 . 
The coronary vasodilating properties of C_D015737 have led to the investigation of this agent for use in D_D000787 . 
Selectivity for the cerebrovascular bed makes C_D009553 potentially useful in the treatment of D_D013345 , D_D008881 , D_D003704 , and D_D020521 . 
In general , the C_C038806 C_D002121 are usually well tolerated , with D_D006261 , facial D_D005483 , D_-1 , D_D004487 , D_D009325 , D_D000855 , and D_D004244 being the more common adverse effects .

title : The enhancement of C_D011692 D_D009401 by the co-administration of protamine . 
abstract : An experimental model of D_D005923 ( D_D005923 ) was developed in rats by the combined administration of puromycin-C_D011692 ( C_D011692 ) and C_D011479 ( C_D011479 ) . 
Male Sprague-Dawley rats , uninephrectomized three weeks before , received daily injections of subcutaneous C_D011692 ( 1 mg/100 g body wt ) and intravenous C_D011479 ( 2 separated doses of 2.5 mg/100 g body wt ) for four days . 
The series of injections were repeated another three times at 10 day intervals . 
The animals were sacrificed on days 24 , 52 , and 80 . 
They developed D_D009404 and finally D_D051437 . 
The time-course curve of C_D003404 clearance dropped and showed significant difference ( P less than 0.01 ) from that of each control group , such as , C_D011692 alone , C_D011479 alone or saline injected . 
Their glomeruli showed changes of progressive D_D005923 . 
The ultrastructural studies in the initial stage revealed significant lack of particles of perfused C_D012428 red on the lamina rara externa and marked changes in epithelial cell cytoplasm . 
Therefore , it is suggested that the administration of C_D011479 enhances the D_D064420 of C_D011692 on the glomerulus and readily produces progressive D_D005923 in rats resulting in the D_D007676 .

title : C_D013806 D_D020258 in pregnant rats . 
abstract : The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the D_D020258 of C_D013806 is altered in advanced pregnancy . 
Sprague-Dawley rats that were 20 days pregnant and nonpregnant rats of the same age and strain received infusions of C_D000628 until onset of maximal D_D012640 which occurred after 28 and 30 minutes respectively . 
C_D013806 concentrations at this endpoint in serum ( total ) and CSF were similar but serum ( free ) and brain concentrations were slightly different in pregnant rats . 
C_D013806 serum protein binding determined by equilibrium dialysis was lower in pregnant rats . 
Fetal serum concentrations at onset of D_D012640 in the mother were similar to maternal brain and CSF concentrations and correlated significantly with the former . 
It is concluded that advanced pregnancy has a negligible effect on the D_D020258 response to C_D013806 in rats .

It is likely that preexisting D_D007674 predisposed this patient to D_D006994 with C_D011453 synthetase inhibitors . 
Because he was unable to discontinue nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy , C_D005438 was added , correcting the D_D006947 and allowing C_D007213 therapy to be continued safely .

title : Participation of a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway in the rat brain in C_D003000-induced D_D007022 and D_D001919 . 
abstract : The effects of microinjection of C_D003000 ( 1-10 micrograms in 1 microliter ) into a region adjacent to the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata on cardiovascular function were assessed in C_D014520-anesthetized rats . 
Intramedullary administration of C_D003000 , but not saline vehicle , caused a dose-dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate . 
The C_D003000-induced D_D007022 was antagonized by prior spinal transection , but not bilateral vagotomy . 
On the other hand , the C_D003000-induced D_D001919 was antagonized by prior bilateral vagotomy , but not spinal transection . 
Furthermore , selective destruction of the spinal C_D012701 nerves , produced by bilateral spinal injection of C_D015116 , reduced the magnitude of the vasodepressor or the D_D001919c responses to C_D003000 microinjected into the area near the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata in rats . 
The data indicate that a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway is involved in development of C_D003000-induced D_D007022 and D_D001919 . 
The induced D_D007022 is brought about by a decrease in sympathetic efferent activity , whereas the induced D_D001919 was due to an increase in vagal efferent activity .

abstract : D_D006973 is a well-known finding in some patients with D_D009447 . 
However , it has not previously been described in association with the use of C_D007099 . 
We report the occurrence of severe D_D006973 ( blood pressure 190/160 ) in a 4-year-old girl with D_D009447 who was given C_D007099 to control a D_D002653 . 
It was determined later that this patient 's D_D009369 was recurring at the time of her D_D006973 episode . 
Since she had no blood pressure elevation at initial diagnosis and none following discontinuation of the C_D007099 ( when she was in florid relapse ) , we believe that this drug rather than her underlying disease alone caused her D_D006973 . 
The mechanism for this reaction is believed to be increased levels of vasoactive C_D002395 due to interference of their physiologic inactivation by C_D007099 . 
From this experience , we urge extreme caution in the use of tricyclic antidepressants in children with active D_D009447 .

title : Rechallenge of patients who developed D_D002180 or D_D006685 with C_D001507 . 
abstract : Of 158 D_D001249 patients who were placed on inhaled C_D001507 , 15 ( 9.5 % ) developed either D_D006685 ( 8 ) , oral D_D002180 ( 6 ) , or both ( 1 ) . 
When their adverse reactions subsided , seven of these 15 patients were rechallenged with inhaled C_D001507 . 
These included five cases who developed D_D006685 and three who developed D_D002177 . 
One patient had both . 
Oral D_D002180 did not recur , but 60 % ( 3/5 ) of patients with D_D006685 had recurrence . 
We conclude that patients may be restarted on inhaled C_D001507 when clinically indicated ; however , because of the high recurrence rate , patients who develop D_D006685 should not be re-challenged . 
Concomitant use of oral C_D011241 and topical C_D001507 may increase the risk of developing D_D006685 or D_D002177 .

title : C_D003520 D_D066126 : an analysis of dosing as a risk factor . 
abstract : Patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation are generally immunosuppressed with a dose of C_D003520 ( C_D003520 ) which is usually calculated based on the patient 's weight . 
At these high doses of C_D003520 , serious D_D066126 may occur , but definitive risk factors for the development of such D_D066126 have not been described . 
Since chemotherapeutic agent D_D064420 generally correlates with dose per body surface area , we retrospectively calculated the dose of C_D003520 in patients transplanted at our institution to determine whether the incidence of C_D003520 D_D066126 correlated with the dose per body surface area . 
Eighty patients who were to receive C_D003520 50 mg/kg/d for four days as preparation for marrow grafting underwent a total of 84 transplants for D_D000741 , D_D014923 , or D_D016511 . 
Fourteen of 84 ( 17 % ) patients had symptoms and signs consistent with C_D003520 D_D066126 within ten days of receiving 1 to 4 doses of C_D003520 . 
Six of the 14 patients died with D_D006333 . 
The dose of C_D003520 per body surface area was calculated for all patients and the patients were divided into two groups based on daily C_D003520 dose : Group 1 , C_D003520 less than or equal to 1.55 g/m2/d ; Group 2 , C_D003520 greater than 1.55 g/m2/d . 
CardioD_D064420 that was thought to be related to C_D003520 occurred in 1/32 ( 3 % ) of patients in Group 1 and in 13/52 ( 25 % ) patients in Group 2 ( P less than 0.025 ) . 
D_D006333 caused or contributed to death in 0/32 patients in Group 1 v 6/52 ( 12 % ) of patients in Group 2 ( P less than 0.25 ) . 
There was no difference in the rate of engraftment of evaluable patients in the two groups ( P greater than 0.5 ) . 
We conclude that the C_D003520 D_D066126 correlates with C_D003520 dosage as calculated by body surface area , and that patients with D_D000741 and D_D007153 can be effectively prepared for bone marrow grafting at a C_D003520 dose of 1.55 g/m2/d for four days with a lower incidence of D_D066126 than patients whose C_D003520 dosage is calculated based on weight . 
This study reaffirms the principle that drug D_D064420 correlates with dose per body surface area .

title : Studies of risk factors for C_D000617 D_D007674 . 
abstract : The epidemiology of C_D000617-induced D_D007674 is not fully understood . 
Experimental studies in healthy human volunteers indicate C_D000617s cause proximal tubular damage in most patients , but rarely , if ever , cause D_D007674 . 
Clinical trials of C_D000617s in seriously ill patients indicate that the relative risk for developing D_D058186 during therapy ranges from 8 to 10 and that the attributable risk is 70 % to 80 % . 
Further analysis of these data suggests that the duration of therapy , plasma C_D000617 levels , D_D008107 , advanced age , high initial estimated C_D003404 clearance and , possibly , female gender all increase the risk for D_D007674 . 
Other causes of D_D058186 , such as D_D012769 , appear to have an additive effect . 
Predictive models have been developed from these analyses that should be useful for identifying patients at high risk . 
These models may also be useful in developing insights into the pathophysiology of C_D000617-induced D_D007674 .

title : C_D005481 D_D012640 thresholds in mice treated neonatally with a single injection of C_D012970 ( C_D012970 ) : evaluation of experimental parameters in C_D005481 D_D012640 testing . 
abstract : C_D012970 ( C_D012970 ) administration to neonatal rodents produces D_D012640 and results in numerous biochemical and behavioral deficits . 
These studies were undertaken to determine if neonatal administration of C_D012970 produced permanent alterations in D_D012640 susceptibility , since previous investigations were inconclusive . 
A C_D005481 C_D004986 D_D012640 screening technique was used to evaluate D_D012640 susceptibility in adult mice that received neonatal injections of C_D012970 ( 4 mg/g and 1 mg/g ) . 
C_D012970 treatment resulted in significant reductions in whole brain weight but did not alter D_D012640 threshold . 
A C_D009270 ( 5 mg/kg ) challenge was also ineffective in altering the D_D012640 thresholds of either control of C_D012970-treated mice . 
C_D005481 C_D004986 produced D_D007035 which was correlated with the duration of C_D005481 exposure ; however , the relationship of D_D007035 to D_D012640 induction was unclear . 
C_D005481 D_D012640 testing proved to be a rapid and reliable technique with which to evaluate D_D012640 susceptibility .

title : Susceptibility to D_D012640 produced by C_D010862 in rats after microinjection of C_D007538 or C_D020888 into the substantia nigra . 
abstract : C_D010862 , given intraperitoneally to rats , reproduces the neuropathological sequelae of D_D004833 and provides a relevant animal model for studying mechanisms of buildup of D_D012640 activity and pathways operative in the generalization and propagation of D_D012640 within the forebrain . 
In the present study , the effects of manipulating the activity of the C_D005680 ( C_D005680 ) -mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra on D_D012640 produced by C_D010862 in rats , were investigated . 
In animals pretreated with microinjections of C_D007538 , 150 micrograms , an inhibitor of activity of the C_D005680-synthesizing enzyme , C_D018698 decarboxylase , into the substantia nigra pars reticulata ( SNR ) , bilaterally , non-convulsant doses of C_D010862 , 100 and 200 mg/kg , resulted in severe motor limbic D_D012640 and D_D013226 . 
Electroencephalographic and behavioral monitoring revealed a profound reduction of the threshold for C_D010862-induced D_D012640 . 
Morphological analysis of frontal forebrain sections with light microscopy revealed D_D012640-related damage to the hippocampal formation , thalamus , amygdala , olfactory cortex , substantia nigra and neocortex , which is typically observed with C_D010862 in doses exceeding 350 mg/kg . 
Bilateral intrastriatal injections of C_D007538 did not augment D_D012640 produced by C_D010862 , 200 mg/kg . 
Application of an irreversible inhibitor of C_D005680 transaminase , C_D020888 ( C_D020888 ) , 5 micrograms , into the SNR , bilaterally , suppressed the appearance of electrographic and behavioral D_D012640 produced by C_D010862 , 380 mg/kg . 
This treatment was also sufficient to protect animals from the occurrence of D_D001930 . 
Microinjections of C_D020888 , 5 micrograms , into the dorsal striatum , bilaterally , failed to prevent the development of D_D012640 produced by C_D010862 , 380 mg/kg . 
The results demonstrate that the threshold for C_D010862-induced D_D012640 in rats is subjected to the regulation of the C_D005680-mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra .

title : Non-invasive detection of D_D003324 by body surface electrocardiographic mapping after C_D004176 infusion . 
abstract : Electrocardiographic changes after C_D004176 infusion ( 0.568 mg/kg/4 min ) were studied in 41 patients with D_D003324 and compared with those after submaximal treadmill exercise by use of the body surface mapping technique . 
Patients were divided into three groups ; 19 patients without D_D009203 ( non-D_D009203 group ) , 14 with D_D056988 ( ANT-D_D009203 ) and eight with D_D056989 ( INF-D_D009203 ) . 
Eighty-seven unipolar electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) distributed over the entire thoracic surface were simultaneously recorded . 
After C_D004176 , D_D007511 ST-segment D_D003866 ( 0.05 mV or more ) was observed in 84 % of the non-D_D009203 group , 29 % of the ANT-D_D009203 group , 63 % of the INF-D_D009203 group and 61 % of the total population . 
Exercise-induced ST D_D003866 was observed in 84 % of the non-D_D009203 group , 43 % of the ANT-D_D009203 group , 38 % of the INF-D_D009203 group and 61 % of the total . 
For individual patients , there were no obvious differences between the body surface distribution of ST D_D003866 in both tests . 
The increase in pressure rate product after C_D004176 was significantly less than that during the treadmill exercise . 
The data suggest that the C_D004176-induced D_D017202 is caused by the inhomogenous distribution of myocardial blood flow . 
We conclude that the C_D004176 ECG test is as useful as the exercise ECG test for the assessment of D_D003324 .

In one of the 5 patients the D_D001919 was associated with complaints of substernal pressure . 
Reversal to normal heart rate was found on day 7 . 
Electrocardiographic registrations showed sinus D_D001919 in all cases . 
No significant changes in plasma concentrations of electrolytes were found . 
Careful observation of patients receiving high-dose C_D008775 is recommended .

We recorded the eye movements of two patients with reversible D_D009759 related to C_D002220 therapy . 
The D_D009759 of both patients resolved after reduction of the serum C_D002220 levels . 
Neuroradiologic investigations including magnetic resonance imaging scans in both patients showed no evidence of intracranial abnormality . 
In patients with D_D009759 who are taking anticonvulsant medications , consideration should be given to reduction in dose before further investigation is undertaken .

abstract : The efficacy of C_C037293 , an orally active beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist , in improving D_D006333 was assessed in dog heart-lung preparations . 
Cardiac functions depressed by C_D010424 ( 118 +/- 28 mg ; mean value +/- SD ) such that cardiac output and maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure ( LV dP/dt max ) had been reduced by about 35 % and 26 % of the respective controls were improved by C_C037293 ( 10-300 micrograms ) in a dose-dependent manner . 
With 100 micrograms C_C037293 , almost complete restoration of cardiac performance was attained , associated with a slight increase in heart rate . 
No D_D001145 were induced by these doses of C_C037293 . 
The results warrant clinical trials of C_C037293 in the treatment of D_D006333 .

abstract : Sixty patients ( age-range one month to 14 years ) with other types of D_D004827 than D_D013036 were treated with C_D002998 . 
Disappearance of D_D012640 and normalization of abnormal EEG with disappearance of D_D012640 were recognized in 77 % and 50 % , respectively . 
D_D012640 disappeared in 71 % of the patients with generalized D_D012640 and 89 % of partial D_D012640 . 
Improvement of abnormal EEG was noticed in 76 % of diffuse paroxysms and in 67 % of focal paroxysms . 
In excellent cases , mean effective dosages were 0.086 +/- 0.021 mg/kg/day in infants and 0.057 +/- 0.022 mg/kg/day in schoolchildren , this difference was statistically significant ( p less than 0.005 ) . 
The incidence of side effects such as D_D006970 and D_D001259 was only 5 % .

Data on 9,037 patients were collected by 1,455 participating physicians . 
Mean systolic blood pressure decreased 25 mmHg and mean diastolic blood pressure declined 15 mmHg after one month of C_D013999-C_D006852 therapy ( P less than 0.01 , both comparisons ) . 
Age , race , and sex appeared to have no influence on the decrease in blood pressure . 
The antiD_D006973 effect of the drug was greater in patients with more severe D_D006973 . 
Overall , 1,453 patients experienced a total of 2,658 adverse events , the most common being D_D005221 , D_D004244 , and D_D018908 .

title : C_D012459 D_D007674 in the Gunn rat : potential role of C_D011453 . 
abstract : We examined the potential role of C_D011453 in the development of analgesic D_D007674 in the Gunn strain of rat . 
The homozygous Gunn rats have unconjugated D_D006932 due to the absence of C_-1 transferase , leading to marked C_D001663 deposition in renal medulla and papilla . 
These rats are also highly susceptible to develop D_D007681 with analgesic administration . 
We used homozygous ( jj ) and phenotypically normal heterozygous ( jJ ) animals . 
Four groups of rats ( n = 7 ) were studied : jj and jJ rats treated either with C_D001241 300 mg/kg every other day or sham-treated . 
After one week , slices of cortex , outer and inner medulla from one kidney were incubated in buffer and C_D011453 synthesis was determined by radioimmunoassay . 
The other kidney was examined histologically . 
A marked corticomedullary gradient of C_D011453 synthesis was observed in all groups . 
C_D015232 synthesis was significantly higher in outer medulla , but not cortex or inner medulla , of jj ( 38 +/- 6 ng/mg prot ) than jJ rats ( 15 +/- 3 ) ( p less than 0.01 ) . 
C_D001241 treatment reduced C_D015232 synthesis in all regions , but outer medullary C_D015232 remained higher in jj ( 18 +/- 3 ) than jJ rats ( 9 +/- 2 ) ( p less than 0.05 ) . 
C_D015237 was also significantly higher in the outer medulla of jj rats with and without C_D001241 administration ( p less than 0.05 ) . 
The changes in renal C_D011453 synthesis were accompanied by evidence of D_D007674 in C_D001241-treated jj but not jJ rats as evidenced by : increased incidence and severity of D_D006417 ( p less than 0.01 ) ; increased serum C_D003404 ( p less than 0.05 ) ; and increase in outer medullary histopathologic lesions ( p less than 0.005 compared to either sham-treated jj or C_D001241-treated jJ ) . 
These results suggest that enhanced C_D011453 synthesis contributes to maintenance of renal function and morphological integrity , and that inhibition of C_D011453 synthesis may lead to D_D058186 and D_D007674 .

title : Prophylactic C_D008012 in the early phase of suspected D_D009203 . 
abstract : Four hundred two patients with suspected D_D009203 seen within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms entered a double-blind randomized trial of C_D008012 vs placebo . 
During the 1 hour after administration of the drug the incidence of D_D014693 or sustained D_D017180 among the 204 patients with acute D_D009203 was low , 1.5 % . 
C_D008012 , given in a 300 mg dose intramuscularly followed by 100 mg intravenously , did not prevent sustained D_D017180 , although there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with warning D_D001145 between 15 and 45 minutes after the administration of C_D008012 ( p less than 0.05 ) . 
The average plasma C_D008012 level 10 minutes after administration for patients without a D_D009203 was significantly higher than that for patients with an acute D_D007238 . 
The mean plasma C_D008012 level of patients on beta-blocking agents was no different from that in patients not on beta blocking agents . 
During the 1-hour study period , the incidence of central nervous system side effects was significantly greater in the C_D008012 group , D_D007022 occurred in 11 patients , nine of whom had received C_D008012 , and four patients died from D_D006323 , three of whom had had C_D008012 . 
We can not advocate the administration of C_D008012 prophylactically in the early hours of suspected D_D009203 .

title : Evidence for a cholinergic role in C_D006220-induced D_D002375 . 
abstract : Experiments in mice tested previous evidence that activation of cholinergic systems promotes D_D002375 and that cholinergic mechanisms need to be intact for full expression of C_D014150-induced D_D002375 . 
Large doses of the cholinomimetic , C_D010862 , could induce D_D002375 when peripheral cholinergic receptors were blocked . 
Low doses of C_D010862 caused a pronounced enhancement of the D_D002375 that was induced by the dopaminergic blocker , C_D006220 . 
A muscarinic receptor blocker , C_D001285 , disrupted C_D006220-induced D_D002375 . 
Intracranial injection of an C_D000109-synthesis inhibitor , C_D006426 , prevented the D_D002375 that is usually induced by C_D006220 . 
These findings suggest the hypothesis that the D_D002375 that is produced by C_D014150s such as C_D006220 is actually mediated by intrinsic central cholinergic systems . 
Alternatively , activation of central cholinergic systems could promote D_D002375 by suppression of dopaminergic systems .

title : D_D002318 and D_D004342 to C_D010424 induced by chronic C_C024986 ingestion . 
abstract : C_D001464-supplemented Long-Evans hooded rats were characterized by a persistent D_D006973 that was evident after 1 month of C_D001464 ( 100 micrograms/ml mineral fortified water ) treatment . 
Analysis of in vivo myocardial excitability , contractility , and metabolic characteristics at 16 months revealed other significant C_D001464-induced D_D002318 . 
The most distinctive aspect of the C_D001464 effect was a demonstrated D_D004342 of the cardiovascular system to C_D010424 . 
Under C_C032232 anesthesia , virtually all of the myocardial contractile indices were depressed significantly in C_D001464-exposed rats relative to the corresponding control-fed rats . 
The lack of a similar response to C_D007649 and C_D014991 anesthesia revealed that the cardiovascular actions of C_D010424 in C_D001464-treated rats were linked specifically to this anesthetic , and were not representative of a generalized anesthetic response . 
Other myocardial pathophysiologic and metabolic changes induced by C_D001464 were manifest , irrespective of the anesthetic employed . 
The contractile element shortening velocity of the cardiac muscle fibers was significantly slower in both groups of C_D001464-treated rats relative to the control groups , irrespective of the anesthetic regimen . 
Similarly , significant disturbances in myocardial energy metabolism were detected in the C_D001464-exposed rats which were consistent with the reduced contractile element shortening velocity . 
In addition , the excitability of the cardiac conduction system was depressed preferentially in the atrioventricular nodal region of hearts from C_D001464-exposed rats . 
Overall , the altered cardiac contractility and excitability characteristics , the myocardial D_D008659 , and the D_D004342 of the cardiovascular system to C_D010424 suggest the existence of a heretofore undescribed D_D009202 induced by chronic C_D001464 exposure . 
These experimental findings represent the first indication that life-long C_D001464 ingestion may have significant adverse effects on the mammalian cardiovascular system .

abstract : C_D010665 ( C_D010665 ) D_D062787 can cause severe D_D006973 , D_D002543 , and death . 
We studied the efficacy and safety of C_D011433 in the treatment of C_D010665-induced D_D006973 . 
Subjects received C_D011433 either by mouth for 48 hours before C_D010665 or as a rapid intravenous infusion after C_D010665 . 
C_D010665 , 75 mg alone , increased blood pressure ( 31 +/- 14 mm Hg systolic , 20 +/- 5 mm Hg diastolic ) , and C_D011433 pretreatment antagonized this increase ( 12 +/- 10 mm Hg systolic , 10 +/- 7 mm Hg diastolic ) . 
Intravenous C_D011433 after C_D010665 also decreased blood pressure . 
Left ventricular function ( assessed by echocardiography ) showed that C_D010665 increased the D_D020521 volume 30 % ( from 62.5 +/- 20.9 to 80.8 +/- 22.4 ml ) , the ejection fraction 9 % ( from 64 % +/- 10 % to 70 % +/- 7 % ) , and cardiac output 14 % ( from 3.6 +/- 0.6 to 4.1 +/- 1.0 L/min ) . 
Intravenous C_D011433 reversed these effects . 
Systemic vascular resistance was increased by C_D010665 28 % ( from 1710 +/- 200 to 2190 +/- 700 dyne X sec/cm5 ) and was further increased by C_D011433 22 % ( to 2660 +/- 1200 dyne X sec/cm5 ) . 
We conclude that C_D010665 increases blood pressure by increasing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output , and that C_D011433 antagonizes this increase by reversing the effect of C_D010665 on cardiac output . 
That C_D011433 antagonizes the pressor effect of C_D010665 is in contrast to the interaction in which C_D011433 enhances the pressor effect of C_D009638 . 
This is probably because C_D010665 has less beta 2 activity than does C_D009638 .

title : Mesangial function and D_D007674 in rats with C_D011692 D_D009401 . 
abstract : The possible relationship between D_D007674 and development of D_D007674 was studied in the puromycin C_D011692 ( C_D011692 ) model . 
Five male Wistar rats received repeated subcutaneous C_D011692 injections ; five controls received saline only . 
After 4 weeks the C_D011692 rats were severely D_D011507 ( 190 +/- 80 mg/24 hr ) , and all rats were given colloidal C_D002244 ( CC ) intravenously . 
At 5 months D_D007674 was found in 7.6 +/- 3.4 % of the glomeruli of C_D011692 rats ; glomeruli of the controls were normal . 
Glomeruli of C_D011692 rats contained significantly more CC than glomeruli of controls . 
Glomeruli with D_D012598 contained significantly more CC than non-sclerotic glomeruli in the same kidneys . 
CC was preferentially localized within the sclerotic areas of the affected glomeruli . 
Since mesangial CC clearance from the mesangium did not change during chronic C_D011692 treatment , we conclude that this preferential CC localization within the lesions is caused by an increased CC uptake shortly after injection in apparent vulnerable areas where D_D012598 will develop subsequently . 
Cluster analysis showed a random distribution of lesions in the C_D011692 glomeruli in concordance with the random localization of mesangial areas with dysfunction in this model . 
Similar to the remnant kidney model in C_D011692 D_D009401 the development of D_D007674 may be related to `` mesangial overloading . ''

title : Relationship between C_D009538-induced D_D012640 and hippocampal nicotinic receptors . 
abstract : A controversy has existed for several years concerning the physiological relevance of the nicotinic receptor measured by alpha-bungarotoxin binding . 
Using mice derived from a classical F2 and backcross genetic design , a relationship between C_D009538-induced D_D012640 and alpha-bungarotoxin nicotinic receptor concentration was found . 
Mice sensitive to the convulsant effects of C_D009538 had greater alpha-bungarotoxin binding in the hippocampus than D_D012640 insensitive mice . 
The binding sites from D_D012640 sensitive and resistant mice were equally affected by treatment with C_D004229 , trypsin or heat . 
Thus it appears that the difference between D_D012640 sensitive and insensitive animals may be due to a difference in hippocampal nicotinic receptor concentration as measured with alpha-bungarotoxin binding .

title : The role of C_C026729 in C_D000082-induced D_D007674 : effect of C_C002887 on C_D000082 and C_C026729 D_D007674 and metabolism in Fischer 344 rats . 
abstract : C_D000082 ( C_D000082 ) produces proximal D_D007683 in Fischer 344 ( F344 ) rats . 
Recently , C_C026729 ( C_C026729 ) , a known potent nephrotoxicant , was identified as a metabolite of C_D000082 in F344 rats . 
The purpose of this study was to determine if C_C026729 formation is a requisite step in C_D000082-induced D_D007674 . 
Therefore , the effect of C_C002887 ( C_C002887 ) , an acylamidase inhibitor , on C_D000082 and C_C026729 D_D007674 and metabolism was determined . 
C_C002887 ( 1 to 8 mM ) reduced C_D000082 deacetylation and covalent binding in F344 renal cortical homogenates in a concentration-dependent manner . 
Pretreatment of animals with C_C002887 prior to C_D000082 or C_C026729 administration resulted in marked reduction of C_D000082 ( 900 mg/kg ) D_D007674 but not C_C026729 D_D007674 . 
This result was not due to altered disposition of either C_D000082 or acetylated metabolites in plasma or renal cortical and hepatic tissue . 
Rather , C_C002887 pretreatment reduced the fraction of C_D000082 excreted as C_C026729 by 64 and 75 % after C_D000082 doses of 750 and 900 mg/kg . 
C_C002887 did not alter the excretion of C_D000082 or any of its non-deacetylated metabolites nor did C_C002887 alter excretion of C_C026729 or its metabolites after C_C026729 doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg . 
Therefore , the C_C002887-induced reduction in C_D000082-induced D_D007674 appears to be due to inhibition of C_D000082 deacetylation . 
It is concluded that C_C026729 formation , in vivo , accounts , at least in part , for C_D000082-induced renal D_D007683 .

title : C_D009020-induced D_D012640 in newborn infants . 
abstract : Two neonates suffered from generalized D_D012640 during the course of intravenous C_D009020 for post-operative analgesia . 
They received C_D009020 in doses of 32 micrograms/kg/hr and 40 micrograms/kg/hr larger than a group of 10 neonates who received 6-24 micrograms/kg/hr and had no D_D012640 . 
Plasma concentrations of C_D009020 in these neonates was excessive ( 60 and 90 mg/ml ) . 
Other known reasons for D_D012640 were ruled out and the D_D012640 stopped a few hours after cessation of C_D009020 and did not reoccur in the subsequent 8 months . 
It is suggested that post-operative intravenous C_D009020 should not exceed 20 micrograms/kg/ml in neonates .

title : Effect of C_D014750 on D_D011552 in monkeys . 
abstract : In rhesus monkeys , intravenous challenge with 0.6 x 10 ( 10 ) to 2.2 x 10 ( 10 ) Pseudomonas aeruginosa organisms caused acute illness of 4 to 5 days ' duration with spontaneous recovery in 13 of 15 monkeys ; blood cultures became negative 3 to 17 days after challenge . 
D_D007964 was observed in all monkeys . 
Intravenous or intratracheal inoculation of 2.0 to 2.5 mg of C_D014750 was followed by D_D007970 in 4 to 5 days . 
Intravenous inoculation of 4.2 x 10 ( 10 ) to 7.8 x 10 ( 10 ) pyocin type 6 Pseudomonas organisms in monkeys given C_D014750 4 days previously resulted in fatal D_D007239 in 11 of 14 monkeys , whereas none of four receiving Pseudomonas alone died . 
These studies suggest that an antimetabolite-induced D_D007970 predisposes to severe Pseudomonas D_D018805 and that such monkeys may serve as a biological model for study of comparative efficacy of antimicrobial agents .

title : Central excitatory actions of C_D005479 . 
abstract : Toxic actions of C_D005479 ( C_D005479 ) were studied in cats , mice and rats . 
High doses caused an apparent central excitation , most clearly seen as clonic D_D012640 , superimposed on general D_D003866 . 
Following a lethal dose , death was always associated with D_D012640 . 
Comparing the relative sensitivity to central D_D003866 and excitation revealed that rats were least likely to have D_D012640 at doses that did not first cause D_D014474 , while cats most clearly showed marked central excitatory actions . 
Signs of C_D005479 D_D064420 in cats included excessive D_D012798 , extreme apprehensive behavior , retching , D_D014202 and D_D012640 . 
An interaction between C_D005479 and C_D010433 ( C_D010433 ) was shown by pretreating mice with C_D005479 before C_D010433 challenge . 
As a function of dose , C_D005479 first protected against D_D012640 and death . 
At higher doses , however , D_D012640 again emerged . 
These doses of C_D005479 were lower than those that would alone cause D_D012640 . 
These results may be relevant to the use of C_D005479 in clinical situations in which there is increased neural excitability , such as D_D004827 or sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal .

title : Evidence for cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptors in man . 
abstract : We compared the effects of single doses of 50 mg C_D001262 ( cardioselective ) , 40 mg C_D011433 ( nonselective ) , and placebo on both exercise- and C_D007545-induced D_D013610 in two experiments involving nine normal subjects . 
Maximal exercise heart rate was reduced from 187 +/- 4 ( SEM ) after placebo to 146 +/- 7 bpm after C_D001262 and 138 +/- 6 bpm after C_D011433 , but there were no differences between the drugs . 
The effects on C_D007545 D_D013610 were determined before and after C_D001285 ( 0.04 mg/kg IV ) . 
C_D007545 sensitivity was determined as the intravenous dose that increased heart rate by 25 bpm ( CD25 ) and this was increased from 1.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms after placebo to 38.9 +/- 8.3 micrograms after C_D011433 and 8.3 +/- 1.7 micrograms after C_D001262 . 
The difference in the effects of the two was significant . 
After C_D001285 the CD25 was unchanged after placebo ( 2.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms ) and C_D001262 ( 7.7 +/- 1.3 micrograms ) ; it was reduced after C_D011433 ( 24.8 +/- 5.0 micrograms ) , but remained different from C_D001262 . 
This change with C_D011433 sensitivity was calculated as the apparent Ka , this was unchanged by C_D001285 ( 11.7 +/- 2.1 and 10.1 +/- 2.5 ml/ng ) . 
These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise-induced D_D013610 results largely from beta 1-receptor activation that is blocked by both cardioselective and nonselective drugs , whereas C_D007545 activates both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors so that after cardioselective blockade there remains a beta 2-component that can be blocked with a nonselective drug . 
While there appear to be beta 2-receptors in the human heart , their physiologic or pathologic roles remain to be defined .

title : Hormones and risk of D_D001943 . 
abstract : This paper reports the results of a study of 50 menopausal women receiving hormonal replacement therapy . 
The majority ( 29 ) had surgical menopause ; their mean age was 45.7 years . 
It was hypothesized that C_D011372 could equilibrate the effects of the C_D004967ic stimulation on the mammary and endometrial target tissues of women on hormonal replacement therapy . 
The treatment schedule consisted of C_D004966 ( C_D004966 ) 1.25 mg/day for 21 days and C_D017258 10 mg/day for 10 days in each month . 
The mean treatment period was 18 months . 
During the follow-up period , attention was paid to breast modifications as evidenced by symptomatology , physical examination , and plate thermography . 
D_D059373 was reported by 21 patients , and physical examination revealed a light increase in breast firmness in 12 women and a moderate increase in breast nodularity in 2 women . 
Themography confirmed the existence of an excessive breast stimulation in 1 women who complained of moderate D_D059373 and in 5 of the 7 women who complained of severe D_D059373 . 
Normalization was obtained by halving the C_D004967 dose . 
These results suggest that hormonal replacement therapy can be safely prescribed if the following criteria are satisfied : 1 ) preliminary evaluation of patients from a clinical , metabolic , cytologic , and mammographic perspective ; 2 ) cyclic treatment schedule , with a progestative phase of 10 days ; and 3 ) periodic complete follow-up , with accurate thermographic evaluation of the breast target tissues .

title : Early D_D007239 in kidney , heart , and liver transplant recipients on C_D016572 . 
abstract : Eighty-one renal , seventeen heart , and twenty-four liver transplant patients were followed for D_D007239 . 
Seventeen renal patients received C_D001379 ( C_D001379 ) and C_D011241 as part of a randomized trial of immunosuppression with 21 C_D016572-and-C_D011241-treated renal transplant patients . 
All others received C_D016572 and C_D011241 . 
The randomized C_D001379 patients had more overall D_D007239 ( P less than 0.05 ) and more nonviral D_D007239 ( P less than 0.02 ) than the randomized C_D016572 patients . 
Heart and liver patients had more D_D007239 than C_D016572 renal patients but fewer D_D007239 than the C_D001379 renal patients . 
There were no infectious deaths in renal transplant patients on C_D016572 or C_D001379 , but D_D007239 played a major role in 3 out of 6 cardiac transplant deaths and in 8 out of 9 liver transplant deaths . 
Renal patients on C_D016572 had the fewest D_D016470 . 
Analysis of site of D_D007239 showed a preponderance of abdominal D_D007239 in liver patients , intrathoracic D_D007239 in heart patients , and urinary tract D_D007239 in renal patients . 
Pulmonary D_D007239 were less common in C_D016572-treated renal patients than in C_D001379-treated patients ( P less than 0.05 ) . 
C_D001379 patients had significantly more staphylococcal D_D007239 than all other transplant groups ( P less than 0.005 ) , and systemic fungal D_D007239 occurred only in the liver transplant group . 
Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) shedding or serological rises in antibody titer , or both occurred in 78 % of C_D016572 patients and 76 % of C_D001379 patients . 
Of the C_D016572 patients , 15 % had symptoms related to CMV D_D007239 . 
Serological evidence for Epstein Barr Virus D_D007239 was found in 20 % of 65 C_D016572 patients studied . 
Three had associated symptoms , and one developed a D_D008223 .

title : Structure-activity and dose-effect relationships of the antagonism of C_D010852-induced D_D012640 by C_D002766 , fragments and analogues of C_D002766 in mice . 
abstract : Intraperitoneal administration of C_D002766 octapeptide sulphate ester ( C_D012844-SE ) and nonsulphated C_D002766 octapeptide ( C_D012844-NS ) enhanced the latency of D_D012640 induced by C_D010852 in mice . 
Experiments with N- and C-terminal fragments revealed that the C-terminal tetrapeptide ( CCK-5-8 ) was the active centre of the CCK octapeptide molecule . 
The analogues C_D012844-SE and C_D012844-NS ( dose range 0.2-6.4 mumol/kg ) and C_D002108 dose range 0.1-0.8 mumol/kg ) showed bell-shaped dose-effect curves , with the greatest maximum inhibition for C_D012844-NS . 
The peptide CCK-5-8 had weak anticonvulsant activity in comparison to the octapeptides , 3.2 mumol/kg and larger doses of the reference drug , C_D003975 , totally prevented C_D010852-induced D_D012640 and mortality . 
The maximum effect of the peptides tested was less than that of C_D003975 . 
Experiments with analogues and derivatives of CCK-5-8 demonstrated that the effectiveness of the beta-alanyl derivatives of CCK-5-8 were enhanced and that they were equipotent with C_D012844-SE . 
Of the CCK-2-8 analogues , Ser ( SO3H ) 7-Ac-CCK-2-8-SE and Thr ( SO3H ) 7-Ac-CCK-2-8-SE and Hyp ( SO3H ) -Ac-CCK-2-8-SE were slightly more active than C_D012844-SE .

title : C_D014667 as a possible contributor to D_D006973 . 
abstract : The role of C_D014667 as a pressor agent to the D_D006973 process was examined . 
C_D014667 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of C_D003900-salt D_D006973 , since the elevation of blood pressure was not substantial in the rats with C_D008094-treated D_D003919 after C_D003900-salt treatment . 
Administration of C_D003894 which has antidiuretic action but minimal vasopressor effect failed to increase blood pressure to the levels observed after administration of AVP . 
Furthermore , the pressor action of C_D014667 appears to be important in the development of this model of D_D006973 , since the enhanced pressor responsiveness to the hormone was observed in the initial stage of D_D006973 . 
Increased secretion of C_D014667 from neurohypophysis also promotes the function of the hormone as a pathogenetic factor in D_D006973 . 
An unproportional release of C_D014667 compared to plasma osmolality may be induced by the absence of an adjusting control of C_D000809 II forming and receptor binding capacity for C_D012964 balance in the brain . 
However , the role of C_D014667 remains to be determined in human essential D_D006973 .

title : D_D001146 and intermittent D_D012848 induced by C_D011433 . 
abstract : D_D001146 and intermittent D_D012848 was observed in a 57-year-old woman , under treatment for D_D000787 with 80 mg C_D011433 daily . 
The electrocardiogram showed alternation of long and short P-P intervals and occasional pauses . 
These pauses were always preceded by the short P-P intervals and were usually followed by one or two P-P intervals of 0.92-0.95 s representing the basic sinus cycle . 
Following these basic sinus cycles , D_D001146 started with the longer P-P interval . 
The long P-P intervals ranged between 1.04-1.12 s and the short P-P intervals between 0.80-0.84 s , respectively . 
The duration of the pauses were equal or almost equal to one short plus one long P-P interval or to twice the basic sinus cycle . 
In one recording a short period of regular sinus rhythm with intermittent 2/1 D_D012848 was observed . 
This short period of sinus rhythm was interrupted by sudden prolongation of the P-P interval starting the alternative rhythm . 
There were small changes in the shape of the P waves and P-R intervals . 
S-A conduction through two pathways , the first with 2/1 block the second having 0.12-0.14 s longer conduction time and with occasional 2/1 block was proposed for the explanation of the alternating P-P interval and other electrocardiographic features seen . 
C_D001285 1 mg given intravenously resulted in shortening of all P-P intervals without changing the rhythm . 
The abnormal rhythm disappeared with the withdrawal of C_D011433 and when the drug was restarted a 2/1 D_D012848 was seen . 
This was accepted as evidence for C_D011433 being the cause of this D_D019955 .

abstract : AntiD_D009369 activity , D_D066126 , and D_D007674 induced by C_D004317 were studied in LOU/M/WSL inbred rats each bearing a transplantable solid IgM D_-1 . 
Animals with a D_D009369 ( diameter , 15.8 +/- 3.3 mm ) were treated with iv injections of C_D004317 on 5 consecutive days , followed by 1 weekly injection for 7 weeks ( dose range , 0.015-4.0 mg/kg body wt ) . 
D_D009369 regression was observed with 0.5 mg C_D004317/kg . 
Complete disappearance of the D_D009369 was induced with 1.0 mg C_D004317/kg . 
Histologic evidence of D_D066126 scored as grade III was only observed at a dose of 1.0 mg C_D004317/kg . 
Light microscopic evidence of D_D007674 was seen above a dose of 0.5 mg C_D004317/kg , which resulted in D_D000419 and very low serum albumin levels . 
In the group that received 1.0 mg C_D004317/kg , the serum albumin level decreased from 33.6 +/- 4.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/liter . 
D_D001201 and D_D006876 were observed simultaneously . 
The same experiments were performed with non-D_D009369-bearing rats , in which no major differences were observed . 
In conclusion , antiD_D009369 activity , D_D066126 , and D_D007674 were studied simultaneously in the same LOU/M/WSL rat . 
D_D000419 due to D_D007674 led to extremely low serum albumin levels , so D_D001201 and D_D006876 were not necessarily a consequence of the observed D_D009202 .

abstract : A 69-yr-old man , who was concurrently being treated with C_D010862 nitrate and C_D013999 maleate eye drops , developed a D_D001919 and became D_D007022 during C_D006221 anaesthesia . 
Both C_D013999 and C_D010862 were subsequently identified in a 24-h collection of urine . 
C_D013999 ( but not C_D010862 ) was detected in a sample of plasma removed during surgery ; the plasma concentration of C_D013999 ( 2.6 ng ml-1 ) was consistent with partial beta-adrenoceptor blockade . 
It is postulated that this action may have been enhanced during C_D006221 anaesthesia with resultant D_D001919 and D_D007022 . 
C_D010862 may have had a contributory effect .

title : C_D013390 D_D001049 : attempted reversal with anticholinesterases . 
abstract : Anticholinesterases were administered in an attempt to antagonize prolonged D_D020879 following the administration of C_D013390 in a patient later found to be homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase . 
C_D004491 10 mg , given 74 min after C_D013390 , when train-of-four stimulation was characteristic of phase II block , produced partial antagonism which was not sustained . 
Repeated doses of C_D004491 to 70 mg and C_D009388 to 2.5 mg did not antagonize or augment the block . 
Spontaneous respiration recommenced 200 min after C_D013390 administration . 
It is concluded that anticholinesterases are only partially effective in restoring neuromuscular function in C_D013390 D_D001049 despite muscle twitch activity typical of phase II block .

title : Effect of C_D004317 on C_C013102 myocardial scintigraphy and echocardiography in dogs . 
abstract : The effects of serial treatment with C_D004317 on dynamic myocardial scintigraphy with C_C013102 ( C_C013102 ) , and on global left-ventricular function determined echocardiographically , were studied in a group of nine mongrel dogs . 
Total extractable myocardial lipid was compared postmortem between a group of control dogs and C_D004317-treated dogs . 
A significant and then progressive fall in global LV function was observed at a cumulative C_D004317 dose of 4 mg/kg . 
A significant increase in the myocardial t1/2 of the C_C013102 was observed only at a higher cumulative dose , 10 mg/kg . 
No significant alteration in total extractable myocardial lipids was observed between control dogs and those treated with C_D004317 . 
Our findings suggest that the changes leading to an alteration of myocardial dynamic imaging with C_C013102 are not the initiating factor in C_D004317 D_D066126 .

title : Hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism under deliberate D_D007022 . 
An experimental study in dogs . 
abstract : Coronary blood flow , cardiac work and metabolism were studied in dogs under C_D009599 ( C_D009599 ) and C_D014294 ( C_D014294 ) deliberate D_D007022 ( 20 % and 40 % mean pressure decrease from baseline ) . 
Regarding the effects of drug-induced D_D007022 on coronary blood flow , aortic and coronary sinus metabolic data ( pH , pC_D010100 , pCC_D010100 ) we could confirm that C_D009599 D_D007022 could be safely used to 30 % mean blood pressure decrease from control , C_D014294 D_D007022 to 20 % mean blood pressure decrease . 
Cardiac work was significantly reduced during C_D009599 D_D007022 . 
Myocardial C_D010100 consumption and C_D010100 availability were directly dependent on the coronary perfusion . 
Careful invasive monitoring of the blood pressure , blood gases and of the ECG ST-T segment is mandatory .

title : Evidence for a selective brain noradrenergic involvement in the locomotor stimulant effects of C_D000661 in the rat . 
abstract : Male rats received the C_D009638 neurotoxin C_C012102 ( 50 mg/kg ) 7 days prior to injection of D-C_D000661 ( 10 or 40 mumol/kg i.p . ) . 
The D_D006948 induced by D-C_D000661 ( 10 mumol/kg ) was significantly reduced by C_C012102 pretreatment . 
However , the increased rearings and the C_D000661-induced D_D019956 were not blocked by pretreatment with C_C012102 . 
The reduction of C_D000661 D_D006948 induced by C_C012102 was blocked by pretreatment with the C_D009638-uptake blocking agent , C_D003891 , which prevents the D_D020258 action of C_C012102 . 
The present results suggest a selective involvement of central noradrenergic neurones in the locomotor stimulant effect of C_D000661 in the rat .

title : D_D001145 during oral C_D014700 therapy . 
abstract : This study examined the frequency of atrioventricular ( AV ) dissociation and D_D001145 in 59 patients receiving oral C_D014700 . 
D_D001145 and AV dissociation were frequent in patients with D_D013617 , particularly AV nodal reentry . 
C_D014700 administration to these patients led to an asymptomatic increase in activity of these junctional pacemakers . 
In patients with various D_D002637 syndromes , C_D014700 neither increased the frequency of junctional rhythms nor suppressed their role as escape rhythms under physiologically appropriate circumstances .

title : Treatment of D_D010051 with a combination of C_D002945 , C_D004317 , C_D003520 and C_D006585 . 
abstract : During the last 2 1/2 years , 38 patients with D_D010051 were treated with a combination of C_D002945 ( C_C034868 ) , 50 mg/m2 , C_D004317 , 30 mg/m2 , C_D003520 , 300 mg/m2 , on day 1 ; and C_D006585 ( C_D006585 ) , 6 mg/kg daily , for 14 days . 
Each course was repeated monthly . 
2 patients had stage II , 14 stage III and 22 stage IV disease . 
14 of the 38 patients were previously treated with chemotherapy , 1 with radiation , 6 with both chemotherapy and radiation , and 17 did not have any treatment before C_C034868 combination . 
31 of the 38 cases ( 81.5 % ) demonstrated objective responses lasting for 2 months or more . 
These responses were partial in 19 and complete in 12 cases . 
D_D006402 was moderate and with reversible D_D000740 developing in 71 % of patients . 
Gastrointestinal side effects from C_C034868 were universal . 
C_D006585 D_D005767 necessitated discontinuation of the drug in 5 patients . 
Severe D_D007674 was observed in 2 patients but was reversible . 
There were no drug-related deaths .

title : Studies on the D_D001919 induced by C_D015764 . 
abstract : C_D015764 , a novel active compound for prophylactic treatment of D_D000787 , induced persistent D_D001919 and a non-specific anti-D_D013610 effect , the mechanisms of which were investigated in vitro and in vivo . 
In vitro perfusion of C_D015764 in the life-support medium for isolated sino-atrial tissue from rabbit heart , caused a reduction in action potential ( AP ) spike frequency ( recorded by C_D011189 microelectrodes ) starting at doses of 5 X 10 ( -6 ) M. This effect was dose-dependent up to concentrations of 5 X 10 ( -5 ) M , whereupon blockade of sinus activity set in . 
C_D015764 at a dose of 5 X 10 ( -6 ) M , induced a concomitant reduction in AP amplitude ( falling from 71 +/- 8 mV to 47 +/- 6 mV ) , maximum systolic depolarization velocity ( phase 0 ) which fell from 1.85 +/- 0.35 V/s to 0.84 +/- 0.28 V/s , together with maximum diastolic depolarization velocity ( phase 4 ) which fell from 38 +/- 3 mV/s to 24 +/- 5 mV/s . 
In vivo injection of C_D015764 at a dose of 5 mg/kg ( i.v . ) 
into 6 anaesthetized dogs which had undergone ablation of all the extrinsic cardiac afferent nerve supply , together with a bilateral medullo-adrenalectomy , caused a marked reduction in heart rate which fell from 98.7 +/- 4.2 beats/min to 76 +/- 5.3 beats/min sustained for more than 45 min . 
It is concluded that C_D015764 reduces heart rate by acting directly on the sinus node . 
This effect , which results in a flattening of the phase 0 and phase 4 slope , together with a longer AP duration , may be due to an increase in the time constants of slow inward ionic currents ( already demonstrated elsewhere ) , but also to an increased time constant for deactivation of the outward C_D011188 current ( Ip ) .

No correlation was found between the severity of clinical manifestations and the total dose taken by the patients . 
In all but 1 patient , antiC_D012293 antibodies were detected . 
Antibodies suggested to be of the IgM class were detected in all 3 patients with D_D006402 . 
The pattern of non-specific D_D007683 found in the 2 biopsied patients , indistinguishable from that of ischemic origin , raised the possibility of a vascular-mediated damage . 
In 3 patients , the possibility of a triggering immunoallergic mechanism is discussed .

title : Cardiovascular effects of D_D007022 induced by C_D000255 and C_D009599 on dogs with denervated hearts . 
abstract : C_D000255 ( C_D000255 ) and C_D009599 ( C_D009599 ) are administered to patients to induce and control D_D007022 during anesthesia . 
C_D009599 is authorized for clinical use in USA and UK , and C_D000255 is clinically used in other countries such as Japan . 
We investigated how these two drugs act on the cardiovascular systems of 20 dogs whose hearts had been denervated by a procedure we had devised . 
C_D000255 ( 10 dogs ) or C_D009599 ( 10 dogs ) was administered to reduce mean arterial pressure by 30 % to 70 % of control . 
Before , during and after induced D_D007022 , we measured major cardiovascular parameters . 
D_D007022 induced by C_D000255 was accompanied by significant decreases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( p less than 0.001 ) , central venous pressure ( p less than 0.001 ) , left ventricular end-diastolic pressure ( p less than 0.001 ) , total peripheral resistance ( p less than 0.001 ) , rate pressure product ( p less than 0.001 ) , total body C_D010100 consumption ( p less than 0.05 ) , and heart rate ( p less than 0.001 ) ; all these variables returned normal within 30 min after C_D000255 was stopped . 
Cardiac output did not change . 
During D_D007022 produced by C_D009599 similar decreases were observed in mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( p less than 0.01 ) , central venous pressure ( p less than 0.001 ) , left ventricular end-diastolic pressure ( p less than 0.01 ) , total peripheral resistance ( p less than 0.001 ) , rate pressure product ( p less than 0.001 ) , and C_D010100 content difference between arterial and mixed venous blood ( p less than 0.05 ) , while heart rate ( p less than 0.001 ) and cardiac output ( p less than 0.05 ) were increased . 
Recoveries of heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were not shown within 60 min after C_D009599 had been stopped . 
Both C_D000255 and C_D009599 should act on the pacemaker tissue of the heart .

abstract : Side effects of hysterosalpingography with C_C025504 , C_D007485 , C_D000100 and C_C006753 in 142 consecutive patients , receiving one of the four tested media were evaluated from replies to postal questionnaires . 
The C_C025504 group had a higher incidence of D_D009325 and D_D004244 . 
The C_C006753 group had a higher incidence of D_D015746 . 
These differences occur especially in the age groups under 30 years . 
C_D007485 and C_D000100 are considered the best C_D003287 for hysterosalpingography and perhaps because of its low D_D064420 C_D007485 should be preferred .

abstract : Contrary to an earlier report by Coxon , C_D013390 D_D010146 occurs in African negroes . 
Its incidence was determined in a prospective study involving a total of 100 Nigerian patients ( 50 out-patients and 50 in-patients ) . 
About 62 % of the out-patients developed C_D013390 D_D010146 as compared with about 26 % among the in-patients . 
The abolition of muscle D_D005207 ( by 0.075mg/kg dose of C_C084773 ) did not influence the occurrence of C_D013390 D_D010146 . 
Neither the type of induction agent ( C_D000530 or C_D013874 ) nor the salt preparation of C_D013390 used ( C_D002712 or C_D001965 ) , affected the incidence of C_D013390 D_D010146 .

title : Medial changes in arterial D_D013035 induced by C_D009638 . 
abstract : In normal rats , the media of small arteries ( 0.4 -- 0.2 mm in diameter ) previously was shown to contain intracellular vacuoles , identified ultrastructurally as herniations of one smooth muscle cell into another . 
The hypothesis that intense vasoconstriction would increase the number of such vacuoles has been tested . 
In the media of the saphenous artery and its distal branch , vasoconstriction induced by C_D009638 produced many cell-to-cell D_D006547 within 15 minutes . 
At 1 day their number was reduced to about 1/10 of the original number . 
By 7 days the vessel was almost restored to normal . 
Triple stimulation over 1 day induced more severe changes in the media . 
These findings suggest that smooth muscle cells are susceptible to damage in the course of their specific function . 
The experimental data are discussed in relation to medial changes observed in other instances of arterial D_D013035 . 
Endothelial changes that developed in the same experimental model were described in a previous paper .

In response to this a marked D_D014313 occurred which lasted for two minutes and the anaesthesia were terminated . 
Four hours of D_D001049 ensued and he suffered generalized severe D_D063806 lasting for one week . 
He was found to have atypical plasma cholinesterase with a C_D003992 number of 12 , indicating homozygocity . 
This was verified by study of the family . 
The case shows that D_D014313 and D_D063806 may occur after C_D013390 in patients with atypical cholinesterase despite pretreatment with C_D010197 .

Anaesthesia was maintained with intermittent C_D005045 in 2-4 mg doses . 
Patients were interviewed personally later the same day , and by questionnaire three to four weeks later . 
The trial was discontinued after 20 cases because of an unacceptable incidence of side effects . 
Venous D_D010146 occurred in 68 % of patients and 50 % had redness , D_D010146 or D_D004487 related to the injection site , in some cases lasting up to three weeks after anaesthesia . 
Skeletal movements occurred in 50 % of patients ; 30 % experienced D_D012140 , one sufficiently severe to necessitate abandoning the technique . 
D_D009325 and D_D014839 occurred in 40 % and 25 % had disturbing emergence D_D011605 .

abstract : We evaluated the severity of D_D009069 and D_D004409 in seven C_D007980-responsive patients with D_D010300 after an acute challenge with the mixed C_D004298 agonist , C_D001058 , before and after the administration of C_D005473 ( 20 mg twice per day ) for 11 +/- 1 days . 
After C_D005473 treatment , there was a significant 47 % improvement ( p < 0.05 ) of C_D001058-induced D_D004409 without modification of D_D010300 D_D009069 . 
The D_D004409 were reduced predominantly in the lower limbs during the onset and disappearance of dystonic D_D004409 ( onset- and end-of-dose D_D004409 ) and in the upper limbs during choreic mid-dose D_D004409 . 
The results suggest that increased brain serotoninergic transmission with C_D005473 may reduce C_D007980- or C_D004298 agonist-induced D_D004409 without aggravating D_D010300 D_D009069 .

title : A large population-based follow-up study of C_D015662 , C_D014295 , and C_D002506 for uncommon serious D_D064420 . 
abstract : We conducted a population-based 45-day follow-up study of 232,390 people who were prescribed C_D015662 ( C_D015662 ) , 266,951 prescribed C_D014295 alone , and 196,397 prescribed C_D002506 , to estimate the risk of serious liver , blood , skin , and renal disorders resulting in referral or hospitalization associated with these drugs . 
The results were based on information recorded on office computers by selected general practitioners in the United Kingdom , together with a review of clinical records . 
The risk of clinically important idiopathic D_D008107 was similar for persons prescribed C_D015662 ( 5.2/100,000 ) and those prescribed C_D014295 alone ( 3.8/100,000 ) . 
The risk for those prescribed C_D002506 was somewhat lower ( 2.0/100,000 ) . 
Only five patients experienced blood disorders , one of whom was exposed to C_D015662 ; of seven with D_D004892 and D_D013262 , four were exposed to C_D015662 . 
The one case of D_D013262 occurred in a patient who took C_D002506 . 
Finally , only five cases of acute parenchymal D_D007674 occurred , none likely to be caused by a study drug . 
We conclude that the risk of the serious diseases studied is small for the three agents , and compares reasonably with the risk for many other antibiotics .

title : Clinical safety of C_D008012 in patients with C_D003042-associated D_D009203 . 
abstract : STUDY OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the safety of C_D008012 in the setting of C_D003042-induced D_D009203 ( D_D009203 ) . 
DESIGN : A retrospective , multicenter study . 
SETTING : Twenty-nine university , university-affiliated , or community hospitals during a 6-year period ( total of 117 cumulative hospital-years ) . 
PARTICIPANTS : Patients with C_D003042-associated D_D009203 who received C_D008012 in the emergency department . 
RESULTS : Of 29 patients who received C_D008012 in the setting of C_D003042-associated D_D009203 , no patient died ; exhibited D_D001919 , D_D017180 , or D_D014693 ; or experienced D_D012640 after administration of C_D008012 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0 % to 11 % ) . 
CONCLUSION : Despite theoretical concerns that C_D008012 may enhance C_D003042 D_D064420 , the use of C_D008012 in patients with C_D003042-associated D_D009203 was not associated with significant cardiovascular or central nervous system D_D064420 .

title : C_D017239 3-hour infusion given alone and combined with C_D016190 : preliminary results of dose-escalation trials . 
abstract : C_D017239 ( C_D017239 ; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company , Princeton , NJ ) by 3-hour infusion was combined with C_D016190 in a phase I/II study directed to patients with D_D002289 . 
C_D016190 was given at a fixed target area under the concentration-time curve of 6.0 by the Calvert formula , whereas C_D017239 was escalated in patient cohorts from 150 mg/m2 ( dose level I ) to 175 , 200 , 225 , and 250 mg/m2 . 
The 225 mg/m2 level was expanded for the phase II study since the highest level achieved ( 250 mg/m2 ) required modification because of nonhematologic D_D064420 ( D_D018771 and D_D012678 ) . 
Therapeutic effects were noted at all dose levels , with objective responses in 17 ( two complete and 15 partial regressions ) of 41 previously untreated patients . 
D_D064420 were compared with a cohort of patients in a phase I trial of C_D017239 alone at identical dose levels . 
C_D016190 did not appear to add to the hematologic D_D064420 observed , and the C_D017239/C_D016190 combination could be dosed every 3 weeks .

title : The dose-dependent effect of C_D016595 on C_D007213-induced D_D007674 in well compensated D_D005355 . 
abstract : C_D016595 ( 200 micrograms ) has been shown to acutely counteract the C_D007213-induced D_D007674 in well compensated D_D005355 patients . 
The aim of this study was to determine if the prophylactic value of C_D016595 was dose-dependent . 
Parameters of renal hemodynamics and tubular C_D012964 and water handling were assessed by clearance techniques in 26 well compensated D_D005355 patients before and after an oral combination of 50 mg of C_D007213 and various doses of C_D016595 . 
The 200-micrograms dose was able to totally abolish the deleterious renal effects of C_D007213 , whereas the 800-micrograms dose resulted in significant worsening of renal hemodynamics and C_D012964 retention . 
These changes were maximal in the hour immediately after medications and slowly returned toward base-line levels thereafter . 
These results suggest that the renal protective effects of C_D016595 is dose-dependent . 
However , until this apparent ability of 200 micrograms of C_D016595 to prevent the adverse effects of C_D007213 on renal function is confirmed with chronic frequent dosing , it would be prudent to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy in patients with D_D005355 .

abstract : Adverse reactions to drugs are well recognized as a cause of acute or chronic D_D014581 , and D_D000799 . 
C_D000806 , used to treat D_D006973 and D_D006333 , were introduced in Europe in the middle of the eighties , and the use of these drugs has increased progressively . 
Soon after the introduction of C_D000806 , acute bouts of D_D000799 were reported in association with the use of these drugs . 
We wish to draw attention to the possibility of adverse reactions to C_D000806 after long-term use and in patients with pre-existing D_D000799 .

abstract : C_D008140 is being used with increasing frequency as a sedative in the newborn and the young infant . 
Concern has been raised with regard to the safety of C_D008140 in this age group , especially in very-low-birth-weight ( VLBW ; < 1,500 g ) infants . 
Three young infants , all of birth weight < 1,500 g , experienced D_D009207 following the intravenous administration of C_D008140 . 
The potential D_D020258 effects of the drug ( and its vehicle ) in this population are discussed . 
Injectable C_D008140 should be used with caution in VLBW infants .

title : Transvenous right ventricular pacing during cardiopulmonary resuscitation of pediatric patients with acute D_D009202 . 
abstract : We describe the cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts on five patients who presented in acute D_D012769 from D_D009202 . 
Three patients had acute viral D_D009205 , one had a C_D002220-induced acute eosinophilic D_D009205 , and one had cardiac hemosiderosis resulting in acute D_D012770 . 
All patients were continuously monitored with central venous and arterial catheters in addition to routine noninvasive monitoring . 
An introducer sheath , a pacemaker , and sterile pacing wires were made readily available for the patients , should the need arise to terminate resistant cardiac D_D001145 . 
All patients developed cardiocirculatory arrest associated with extreme D_D007022 and D_D001145 within the first 48 hours of their admission to the pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) . 
Right ventricular pacemaker wires were inserted in all of them during cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) . 
In four patients , cardiac pacing was used , resulting in a temporary captured rhythm and restoration of their cardiac output . 
These patients had a second event of D_D006323 , resulting in death , within 10 to 60 minutes . 
In one patient , cardiac pacing was not used , because he converted to normal sinus rhythm by electrical defibrillation within three minutes of initiating CPR . 
We conclude that cardiac pacing during resuscitative efforts in pediatric patients suffering from acute D_D009202 may not have long-term value in and of itself ; however , if temporary hemodynamic stability is achieved by this procedure , it may provide additional time needed to institute other therapeutic modalities .

title : Efficacy and safety of C_D017829 , a selective C_D012701-3 receptor antagonist , in the prevention of D_D009325 and D_D014839 induced by high-dose C_D002945 . 
abstract : PURPOSE : To assess the antiemetic effects and safety profile of four different doses of C_D017829 ( C_D017829 ; SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals , Philadelphia , PA ) when administered as a single intravenous ( IV ) dose for prophylaxis of C_D002945-induced D_D009325 and D_D014839 . 
PATIENTS AND METHODS : One hundred eighty-four chemotherapy-naive patients receiving high-dose C_D002945 ( 81 to 120 mg/m2 ) were randomized to receive one of four C_D017829 doses ( 5 , 10 , 20 , or 40 micrograms/kg ) administered before chemotherapy . 
Patients were observed on an inpatient basis for 18 to 24 hours , and vital signs , D_D009325 , D_D014839 , retching , and appetite were assessed . 
Safety analyses included incidence of adverse experiences and laboratory parameter changes . 
RESULTS : After C_D017829 doses of 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 micrograms/kg , a major response ( < or = two D_D014839 or retching episodes , and no antiemetic rescue ) was recorded in 23 % , 57 % , 58 % , and 60 % of patients , respectively , and a complete response ( no D_D014839 or retching , and no antiemetic rescue ) in 18 % , 41 % , 40 % , and 47 % of patients , respectively . 
There was a statistically longer time to first episode of D_D009325 ( P = .0015 ) and D_D014839 ( P = .0001 ) , and fewer patients were administered additional antiemetic medication in the 10-micrograms/kg dosing groups than in the 5-micrograms/kg dosing group . 
As C_D017829 dose increased , appetite return increased ( P = .040 ) . 
D_D006261 was the most frequently reported adverse event ( 20 % ) . 
CONCLUSION : A single 10- , 20- , or 40-micrograms/kg dose of C_D017829 was effective in controlling D_D014839 in 57 % to 60 % of patients who received C_D002945 at doses greater than 81 mg/m2 and totally prevented D_D014839 in 40 % to 47 % of patients . 
There were no statistically significant differences in efficacy between the 10-micrograms/kg dose and the 20- and 40-micrograms/kg doses . 
C_D017829 was well tolerated at all doses .

title : Adverse interaction between C_D003000 and C_D014700 . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : To report two cases of a possible adverse interaction between C_D003000 and C_D014700 resulting in D_D054537 in both patients and severe D_D007022 in one patient . 
CASE SUMMARIES : A 54-year-old woman with D_D006929 was treated with C_D014700 480 mg/d and C_D013148 100 mg/d . 
After the addition of a minimal dose of C_D003000 ( 0.15 mg bid ) , she developed complete D_D054537 and severe D_D007022 , which resolved upon cessation of all medications . 
A 65-year-old woman was treated with extended-release C_D014700 240 mg/d . 
After the addition of C_D003000 0.15 mg bid she developed complete D_D054537 , which resolved after all therapy was stopped . 
DISCUSSION : An adverse interaction between C_D003000 and C_D014700 has not been reported previously . 
We describe two such cases and discuss the various mechanisms that might cause such an interaction . 
Clinicians should be acquainted with this possibly fatal interaction between two commonly used antihypertensive drugs . 
CONCLUSIONS : Caution is recommended in combining C_D003000 and C_D014700 therapy , even in patients who do not have sinus or AV node dysfunction . 
The two drugs may act synergistically on both the AV node and the peripheral circulation .

DESIGN : Male Sprague-Dawley rats received 100 mg/kg C_D003042 IP alone , 5 mg/kg C_D003975 alone , or a combination of C_D003975 and C_D003042 . 
Three minutes later , groups were challenged with vehicle or C_D005442 5 or 10 mg/kg IP . 
Animal behavior , D_D012640 ( time to and incidence ) , death ( time to and incidence ) , and cortical EEG tracings were recorded . 
INTERVENTIONS : Administration of C_D005442 to animals after they had received a combination dose of C_D003042 and C_D003975 . 
RESULTS : In group 1 , animals received C_D003042 followed by vehicle . 
This resulted in 100 % developing D_D012640 and death . 
Group 2 received C_D003975 alone followed by vehicle . 
Animals became somnolent and none died . 
Group 3 received C_D003975 followed by 5 mg/kg C_D005442 . 
Animals became somnolent after C_D003975 and then active after C_D005442 administration . 
In group 4 , a combination of C_D003042 and C_D003975 was administered simultaneously . 
This resulted in no overt or EEG-detectable D_D012640 and a 50 % incidence of death . 
Group 5 received a similar combination of C_D003042 and C_D003975 , followed later by 5 mg/kg C_D005442 . 
This resulted in an increased incidence of D_D012640 , 90 % ( P < .01 ) , and death , 100 % ( P < or = .01 ) , compared with group 4 . 
Group 6 received C_D003042 and C_D003975 followed by 10 mg/kg C_D005442 . 
This also resulted in an increased incidence of D_D012640 , 90 % ( P < or = .01 ) , and death , 90 % ( P < or = .05 ) , compared with group 4 . 
CONCLUSION : C_D005442 can unmask D_D012640 and increase the incidence of death in a model of combined C_D003042-C_D003975 intoxications .

title : Mechanisms for protective effects of free radical scavengers on C_D005839-mediated D_D007674 in rats . 
abstract : Studies were performed to examine the mechanisms for the protective effects of free radical scavengers on C_D005839 ( C_D005839 ) -mediated D_D007674 . 
Administration of C_D005839 at 40 mg/kg sc for 13 days to rats induced a significant reduction in renal blood flow ( RBF ) and inulin clearance ( CIn ) as well as marked D_D007674 . 
A significant reduction in urinary C_D006152 ( cC_D005839P ) excretion and a significant increase in renal cortical renin and endothelin-1 contents were also observed in C_D005839-mediated D_D007674 . 
C_D013481 dismutase ( SOD ) or C_C038983 ( C_C038983 ) significantly lessened the C_D005839-induced decrement in CIn . 
The SOD-induced increase in glomerular filtration rate was associated with a marked improvement in RBF , an increase in urinary cC_D005839P excretion , and a decrease in renal renin and endothelin-1 content . 
SOD did not attenuate the D_D007674 . 
In contrast , C_C038983 significantly reduced the D_D007674 and lipid peroxidation , but it did not affect renal hemodynamics and vasoactive substances . 
Neither SOD nor C_C038983 affected the renal cortical C_D005839 content in C_D005839-treated rats . 
These results suggest that 1 ) both SOD and C_C038983 have protective effects on C_D005839-mediated D_D007674 , 2 ) the mechanisms for the protective effects differ for SOD and C_C038983 , and 3 ) C_D013481 anions play a critical role in C_D005839-induced renal vasoconstriction .

title : Assessment of cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis during D_D006984 in adult mice . 
abstract : The ability of cardiomyocytes to synthesize DNA in response to experimentally induced cardiac D_D006984 was assessed in adult mice . 
C_D007545 delivered by osmotic minipump implantation in adult C3Heb/FeJ mice resulted in a 46 % increase in heart weight and a 19.3 % increase in cardiomyocyte area . 
No DNA synthesis , as assessed by autoradiographic analysis of isolated cardiomyocytes , was observed in control or D_D006332 . 
A survey of 15 independent inbred strains of mice revealed that ventricular cardiomyocyte nuclear number ranged from 3 to 13 % mononucleate , suggesting that cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation is influenced directly or indirectly by genetic background . 
To determine whether the capacity for reactive DNA synthesis was also subject to genetic regulation , cardiac D_D006984 was induced in the strains of mice comprising the extremes of the nuclear number survey . 
These data indicate that adult mouse atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes do not synthesize DNA in response to C_D007545-induced cardiac D_D006984 .

title : Central cardiovascular effects of C_D001127 and ANP in normotensive and spontaneously D_D006973 rats . 
abstract : The purpose of the present study was to compare influence of central C_D001127 ( C_D001127 ) and of atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) on control of arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) and heart rate ( HR ) in normotensive ( WKY ) and spontaneously D_D006973 ( SHR ) rats . 
Three series of experiments were performed on 30 WKY and 30 SHR , chronically instrumented with guide tubes in the lateral ventricle ( LV ) and arterial and venous catheters . 
MAP and HR were monitored before and after i.v . 
injections of either vehicle or 1 , 10 and 50 ng of C_D001127 and 25 , 125 and 500 ng of ANP . 
Sensitivity of cardiac component of baroreflex ( CCB ) , expressed as a slope of the regression line was determined from relationships between systolic arterial pressure ( SAP ) and HR period ( HRp ) during C_D010656 ( C_D010656 ) -induced D_D006973 and C_D009599 ( C_D009599 ) -induced D_D007022 . 
CCB was measured before and after administration of either vehicle , C_D001127 , ANP , or both peptides together . 
Increases of MAP occurred after LV administration of 1 , 10 and 50 ng of C_D001127 in WKY and of 10 and 50 ng in SHR . 
ANP did not cause significant changes in MAP in both strains as compared to vehicle , but it abolished C_D001127-induced MAP increase in WKY and SHR . 
CCB was reduced in WKY and SHR after LV administration of C_D001127 during C_D009599-induced D_D007022 . 
In SHR but not in WKY administration of ANP , C_D001127 and ANP + C_D001127 decreased CCB during C_D010656-induced MAP elevation . 
The results indicate that centrally applied C_D001127 and ANP exert differential effects on blood pressure and baroreflex control of heart rate in WKY and SHR and suggest interaction of these two peptides in blood pressure regulation at the level of central nervous system .

abstract : A case of intercerebral D_D006406 due to C_D014859-induced D_D001778 is presented . 
The 39-year-old woman had spread a C_D014859-type rat poison around her house weekly using her bare hands , with no washing post application . 
Percutaneous absorption of C_D014859 causing D_D001778 , reported three times in the past , is a significant risk if protective measures , such as gloves , are not used . 
An adverse drug interaction with C_D010894 , which she took occasionally , may have exacerbated the D_D001778 .

title : Pediatric heart transplantation without chronic maintenance C_D013256 . 
abstract : From 1986 to February 1993 , 40 children aged 2 months to 18 years ( average age 10.4 +/- 5.8 years ) underwent heart transplantation . 
Indications for transplantation were D_D002311 ( 52 % ) , D_D006331 ( 35 % ) with and without prior repair ( 71 % and 29 % , respectively ) , D_D002312 ( 5 % ) , D_D006349 ( 3 % ) , and C_D004317 D_D009202 ( 5 % ) . 
Patients were managed with C_D016572 and C_D001379 . 
No prophylaxis with antilymphocyte globulin was used . 
C_D013256 were given to 39 % of patients for refractory rejection , but weaning was always attempted and generally successful ( 64 % ) . 
Five patients ( 14 % ) received maintenance C_D013256 . 
Four patients died in the perioperative period and one died 4 months later . 
There have been no deaths related to rejection or D_D007239 . 
Average follow-up was 36 +/- 19 months ( range 1 to 65 months ) . 
Cumulative survival is 88 % at 5 years . 
In patients less than 7 years of age , rejection was monitored noninvasively . 
In the first postoperative month , 89 % of patients were treated for rejection . 
Freedom from serious D_D007239s was 83 % at 1 month and 65 % at 1 year . 
Cytomegalovirus D_D007239s were treated successfully with C_D015774 in 11 patients . 
No impairment of growth was observed in children who underwent transplantation compared with a control population .

title : D_D003693 during C_D005473 treatment . 
A case report . 
abstract : The correlation between high serum tricyclic antidepressant concentrations and central nervous system side effects has been well established . 
Only a few reports exist , however , on the relationship between the serum concentrations of selective C_D012701 reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and their toxic effects . 
In some cases , a high serum concentration of C_D015283 ( > 600 nmol/L ) in elderly patients has been associated with increased D_D006970 and D_D020820 . 
Widespread D_D003072 , such as D_D003693 , have not been previously linked with high blood levels of SSRIs . 
In this report , we describe a patient with acute D_D006948 D_D003693 connected with a high serum total C_D005473 ( C_D005473 plus desmethylC_D005473 ) concentration .

title : D_D011654 and D_D012769 after high-dose C_D003561 for D_D008223 ; possible role of TNF-alpha and PAF . 
abstract : Four out of 23 consecutive patients treated with high-dose C_D003561 for D_D008223s in our institution developed a strikingly similar syndrome during the perfusion . 
It was characterized by the onset of D_D005334 , D_D003967 , D_D012769 , D_D011654 , D_D058186 , D_D000138 , D_D015430 and D_D007964 . 
Thorough bacteriological screening failed to provide evidence of D_D007239 . 
Sequential biological assays of IL-1 , IL-2 , TNF and PAF were performed during C_D003561 infusion to ten patients , including the four who developed the syndrome . 
TNF and PAF activity was found in the serum of respectively two and four of the cases , but not in the six controls . 
As TNF and PAF are thought to be involved in the development of septic D_D012769 and D_D012128 , we hypothesize that high-dose C_D003561 may be associated with cytokine release .

title : Protective effect of C_C056595 against C_D004837-induced D_D006331 in rats . 
abstract : We investigated the effects of C_C056595 , a C_C106746 C_D002118 antagonist , on C_D004837-induced D_D009202 in rats . 
With 2-week chronic C_D004837 infusion , 16 of 30 rats died within 4 days , and severe D_D007511 and D_D005355 of the left ventricles were observed . 
In C_D004837-treated rats , left atrial and left ventricular papillary muscle contractile responses to C_D007545 were reduced , but responses to C_D002118 were normal or enhanced compared to controls . 
Left ventricular alpha and beta adrenoceptor densities were also reduced compared to controls . 
Treatment with C_C056595 prevented C_D004837-induced death ( P < .05 ) , and attenuated the ventricular D_D007511 and D_D005355 , in a dose-dependent manner . 
Left atrial and left ventricular papillary muscle contractile responses to C_D007545 were reduced compared to controls in groups treated with C_C056595 alone , but combined with C_D004837 , C_C056595 restored left atrial responses and enhanced left ventricular papillary responses to C_D007545 . 
On the other hand C_C056595 did not prevent C_D004837-induced down-regulation of alpha and beta adrenoceptors . 
Interestingly , C_C056595 , infused alone , resulted in decreased adrenergic receptor densities in the left ventricle . 
C_C056595 also did not prevent the enhanced responses to C_D002118 seen in the C_D004837-treated animals , although the high dose of C_C056595 partially attenuated the maximal response to C_D002118 compared to C_D004837-treated animals . 
In conclusion , C_C056595 attenuated C_D004837-induced D_D006331 , possibly through its effect on the adrenergic pathway .

title : C_D004317-induced D_D066126 monitored by ECG in freely moving mice . 
A new model to test potential protectors . 
abstract : In laboratory animals , histology is most commonly used to study C_D004317-induced D_D066126 . 
However , for monitoring during treatment , large numbers of animals are needed . 
Recently we developed a new method to measure ECG values in freely moving mice by telemetry . 
With this model we investigated the effect of chronic C_D004317 administration on the ECG of freely moving BALB/c mice and the efficacy of C_D064730 as a protective agent . 
The ST interval significantly widened from 15.0 +/- 1.5 to 56.8 +/- 11.8 ms in week 10 ( 7 weekly doses of 4 mg/kg C_D004317 given i.v . 
plus 3 weeks of observation ) . 
The ECG of the control animals did not change during the entire study . 
After sacrifice the hearts of C_D004317-treated animals were enlarged and the atria were D_D006984 . 
As this schedule exerted more D_D064420 than needed to investigate protective agents , the protection of C_D064730 was determined using a dose schedule with lower general D_D064420 ( 6 weekly doses of 4 mg/kg C_D004317 given i.v . 
plus 2 weeks of observation ) . 
On this schedule , the animals ' hearts appeared normal after sacrifice and C_D064730 ( 50 mg/kg given i.p . 
1 h before C_D004317 ) provided almost full protection . 
These data were confirmed by histology . 
The results indicate that this new model is very sensitive and enables monitoring of the development of D_D066126 with time . 
These findings result in a model that allows the testing of protectors against C_D004317-induced D_D066126 as demonstrated by the protection provided by C_D064730 .

title : C_D004837 dysrhythmogenicity is not enhanced by subtoxic C_D002045 in dogs . 
abstract : Since C_D002045 and C_D004837 may both precipitate D_D001145 , circulating C_D002045 during regional anesthesia could potentiate dysrhythmogenic effects of C_D004837 . 
We therefore examined whether C_D002045 alters the dysrhythmogenicity of subsequent administration of C_D004837 in conscious , healthy dogs and in anesthetized dogs with D_D009203 . 
Forty-one conscious dogs received 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 C_D004837 . 
Seventeen animals responded with D_D017180 ( D_D017180 ) within 3 min . 
After 3 h , these responders randomly received 1 or 2 mg/kg C_D002045 or saline over 5 min , followed by 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 C_D004837 . 
In the C_D002045 groups , C_D004837 caused fewer prodysrhythmic effects than without C_D002045 . 
D_D017180 appeared in fewer dogs and at a later time , and there were more sinoatrial beats and less ectopies . 
C_D004837 shortened QT less after C_D002045 than in control animals . 
One day after experimental D_D009203 , six additional C_D006221-anesthetized dogs received 4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 C_D004837 until D_D017180 appeared . 
After 45 min , 1 mg/kg C_D002045 was injected over 5 min , again followed by 4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 C_D004837 . 
In these dogs , the prodysrhythmic response to C_D004837 was also mitigated by preceding C_D002045 . 
C_D002045 antagonizes C_D004837 dysrhythmogenicity in conscious dogs susceptible to D_D017180 and in anesthetized dogs with spontaneous postinfarct D_D001145 . 
There is no evidence that systemic subtoxic C_D002045 administration enhances the dysrhythmogenicity of subsequent C_D004837 .

title : D_D006934 induced by C_D002117 in a patient with D_D007011 . 
abstract : D_D006934 was first described 70 years ago in the context of the treatment of D_D010437 with large amounts of C_D002118 and C_D000468 . 
Although with current D_D014456 therapy ( H-2 blockers , C_D009853 , and C_D013392 ) , the frequency of milk-C_D000468 syndrome has decreased significantly , the classic triad of D_D006934 , D_D000471 , and D_D051437 remains the hallmark of the syndrome . 
D_D006934 can present serious and occasionally life-threatening illness unless diagnosed and treated appropriately . 
This article presents a patient with D_D007011 who was treated with C_D002118 carbonate and C_D002117 resulting in two admissions to the hospital for milk-C_D000468 syndrome . 
The patient was successfully treated with intravenous C_C019248 on his first admission and with C_D006854 on the second . 
This illustrates intravenous C_C019248 as a valuable therapeutic tool when milk-C_D000468 syndrome presents as D_D006934 .

title : D_D001927 during C_D000639 therapy : are D_D009459 and D_D020230 spectrum disorders ? 
abstract : This report describes a case of D_D001927 developed in the course of C_D000639 therapy , during a remission of D_D003866 . 
This patient could have been diagnosed as having either D_D009459 ( D_D009459 ) or D_D020230 ( D_D020230 ) . 
The major determinant of the symptoms may have been C_D004298/C_D012701 imbalance in the central nervous system . 
The D_D009459-like D_D001927 that develops in association with the use of antidepressants indicates that D_D009459 and D_D020230 are spectrum disorders induced by drugs with both antiC_D004298rgic and serotonergic effects .

title : Genetic separation of D_D009369 growth and D_D006470 phenotypes in an C_D004967-induced D_D009369 . 
abstract : Chronic administration of C_D004967 to the Fischer 344 ( F344 ) rat induces growth of large , D_D006470 pituitary D_D009369s . 
Ten weeks of C_D004054 ( C_D004054 ) treatment caused female F344 rat pituitaries to grow to an average of 109.2 +/- 6.3 mg ( mean +/- SE ) versus 11.3 +/- 1.4 mg for untreated rats , and to become highly D_D006470 . 
The same C_D004054 treatment produced no significant growth ( 8.9 +/- 0.5 mg for treated females versus 8.7 +/- 1.1 for untreated females ) or morphological changes in Brown Norway ( BN ) rat pituitaries . 
An F1 hybrid of F344 and BN exhibited significant pituitary growth after 10 weeks of C_D004054 treatment with an average mass of 26.3 +/- 0.7 mg compared with 8.6 +/- 0.9 mg for untreated rats . 
Surprisingly , the F1 hybrid D_D009369s were not D_D006470 and had hemoglobin content and outward appearance identical to that of BN . 
Expression of both growth and morphological changes is due to multiple genes . 
However , while C_D004054-induced pituitary growth exhibited quantitative , additive inheritance , the D_D006470 phenotype exhibited recessive , epistatic inheritance . 
Only 5 of the 160 F2 pituitaries exhibited the D_D006470 phenotype ; 36 of the 160 F2 pituitaries were in the F344 range of mass , but 31 of these were not D_D006470 , indicating that the D_D006470 phenotype is not merely a consequence of extensive growth . 
The D_D006470 F2 pituitaries were all among the most massive , indicating that some of the genes regulate both phenotypes .

title : Increased expression of neuronal C_D009569 synthase in bladder afferent pathways following chronic D_D001745 . 
abstract : Immunocytochemical techniques were used to examine alterations in the expression of neuronal C_D009569 synthase ( NOS ) in bladder pathways following acute and chronic D_D014570 of the rat . 
Chemical D_D003556 was induced by C_D003520 ( C_D003520 ) which is metabolized to C_D000171 , an irritant eliminated in the urine . 
Injection of C_D003520 ( n = 10 , 75 mg/kg , i.p . ) 
2 hours prior to perfusion ( acute treatment ) of the animals increased Fos-immunoreactivity ( IR ) in neurons in the dorsal commissure , dorsal horn , and autonomic regions of spinal segments ( L1-L2 and L6-S1 ) which receive afferent inputs from the bladder , urethra , and ureter . 
Fos-IR in the spinal cord was not changed in rats receiving chronic C_D003520 treatment ( n = 15 , 75 mg/kg , i.p. , every 3rd day for 2 weeks ) . 
In control animals and in animals treated acutely with C_D003520 , only small numbers of NOS-IR cells ( 0.5-0.7 cell profiles/sections ) were detected in the L6-S1 dorsal root ganglia ( DRG ) . 
Chronic C_D003520 administration significantly ( P < or = .002 ) increased bladder weight by 60 % and increased ( 7- to 11-fold ) the numbers of NOS-immunoreactive ( IR ) afferent neurons in the L6-S1 DRG . 
A small increase ( 1.5-fold ) also occurred in the L1 DRG , but no change was detected in the L2 and L5 DRG . 
Bladder afferent cells in the L6-S1 DRG labeled by Fluorogold ( 40 microliters ) injected into the bladder wall did not exhibit NOS-IR in control animals ; however , following chronic C_D003520 administration , a significant percentage of bladder afferent neurons were NOS-IR : L6 ( 19.8 +/- 4.6 % ) and S1 ( 25.3 +/- 2.9 % ) . 
These results indicate that neuronal gene expression in visceral sensory pathways can be upregulated by chemical irritation of afferent receptors in the urinary tract and/or that pathological changes in the urinary tract can initiate chemical signals that alter the chemical properties of visceral afferent neurons .

title : Effects of a new C_D002118 antagonist , C_C082828 , on C_D007545-induced D_D017202 in dogs with partial D_D023921 . 
abstract : Effects of C_C082828 on C_D007545 ( C_D007545 ) -induced D_D017202 were studied in dogs with partial D_D023921 of the left circumflex coronary artery and findings were compared with those for C_D009543 or C_D004110 . 
In the presence of D_D023921 , 3-min periods of intracoronary C_D007545 infusion ( 10 ng/kg/min ) increased heart rate and maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise , which resulted in a decrease in percentage segmental shortening and ST-segment elevation of the epicardial electrocardiogram . 
After the control C_D007545 infusion with D_D003251 was performed , equihypotensive doses of C_C082828 ( 3 and 10 micrograms/kg/min , n = 7 ) , C_D009543 ( 1 and 3 micrograms/kg/min , n = 9 ) or C_D004110 ( 10 and 30 micrograms/kg/min , n = 7 ) were infused 5 min before and during the second and third C_D007545 infusion . 
Both C_C082828 and C_D004110 , but not C_D009543 , significantly reduced the increase in heart rate induced by C_D007545 infusion . 
In contrast to C_D009543 , C_C082828 ( 10 micrograms/kg/min ) prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 32 +/- 12 % to 115 +/- 26 % of the control value ( P < .01 ) and ST-segment elevation from 5.6 +/- 1.0 mV to 1.6 +/- 1.3 mV ( P < .01 ) at 3 min after C_D007545 infusion with D_D003251 . 
C_D004110 ( 30 micrograms/kg/min ) also prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 34 +/- 14 % to 63 +/- 18 % of the control value ( P < .05 ) and ST-segment elevation from 4.7 +/- 0.7 mV to 2.1 +/- 0.7 mV ( P < .01 ) at 3 min after C_D007545 infusion with D_D003251 . 
These data show that C_C082828 improves D_D017202 during C_D007545 infusion with D_D003251 and suggest that the negative chronotropic property of C_C082828 plays a major role in the beneficial effects of C_C082828 .

title : The effect of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I on chronic C_D011692 D_D007674 in rats . 
abstract : We recently demonstrated that recombinant hGH exacerbates renal functional and structural injury in chronic C_D011692 ( C_D011692 ) D_D007674 , an experimental model of D_D007674 . 
Therefore , we examined whether recombinant human ( rh ) IGF-I is a safer alternative for the treatment of D_D006130 in rats with chronic C_D011692 D_D007674 . 
The D_D007674 was induced by seven serial injections of C_D011692 over 12 wk . 
Experimental animals ( n = 6 ) received rhIGF-I , 400 micrograms/d , whereas control rats ( n = 6 ) received the vehicle . 
rhIGF-I improved weight gain by 14 % ( p < 0.05 ) , without altering hematocrit or blood pressure in rats with D_D007674 . 
Urinary protein excretion was unaltered by rhIGF-I treatment in rats with chronic C_D011692 D_D007674 . 
After 12 wk , the inulin clearance was higher in rhIGF-I-treated rats , 0.48 +/- 0.08 versus 0.24 +/- 0.06 mL/min/100 g of body weight in untreated C_D011692 D_D007674 animals , p < 0.05 . 
The improvement in GFR was not associated with enhanced D_D007674 or increased segmental D_D005921 , D_-1 , or renal cortical C_D008315 content . 
In rats with C_D011692 D_D007674 , administration of rhIGF-I increased IGF-I and GH receptor gene expression , without altering the steady state level of IGF-I receptor mRNA . 
In normal rats with intact kidneys , rhIGF-I administration ( n = 4 ) did not alter weight gain , blood pressure , D_D011507 , GFR , glomerular planar area , renal cortical C_D008315 content , or glomerular or D_D007674 , compared with untreated animals ( n = 4 ) . 
rhIGF-I treatment reduced the steady state renal IGF-I mRNA level but did not modify gene expression of the IGF-I or GH receptors . 
We conclude that : 1 ) administration of rhIGF-I improves growth and GFR in rats with chronic C_D011692 D_D007674 and 2 ) unlike rhGH , long-term use of rhIGF-I does not worsen renal functional and structural injury in this disease model .

title : C_C058876 ( C_C058876 ) reverses C_D001058-induced D_D000647 of a passive avoidance response : delayed emergence of the memory retention effects . 
abstract : C_C058876 is a novel C_D011760 derivative which attenuates C_D012601-induced D_D007859 . 
Given that C_D001058 inhibits passive avoidance retention when given during training or in a defined 10-12h post-training period , we evaluated the ability of C_C058876 to attenuate D_D000647 induced by C_D004298rgic agonism . 
A step-down passive avoidance paradigm was employed and C_C058876 ( 3 mg/kg ) and C_D001058 ( 0.5 mg/kg ) were given alone or in combination during training and at the 10-12h post-training period of consolidation . 
Co-administration of C_C058876 and C_D001058 during training or 10h thereafter produced no significant anti-amnesic effect . 
However , administration of C_C058876 during training completely reversed the D_D000647 induced by C_D001058 at the 10h post-training time and the converse was also true . 
These effects were not mediated by a C_D004298rgic mechanism as C_C058876 , at millimolar concentrations , failed to displace either [ 3H ] C_C534628 or [ 3H ] C_D013134 binding from D1 or D2 C_D004298 receptor subtypes , respectively . 
It is suggested that C_C058876 augments molecular processes in the early stages of events which ultimately lead to consolidation of memory .

title : Human C_D000324-releasing hormone and C_D013972-releasing hormone modulate the D_D006935 ventilatory response in humans . 
abstract : Human C_D000324-releasing hormone ( hCRH ) and C_D013972-releasing hormone ( TRH ) are known to stimulate ventilation after i.v . 
administration in humans . 
In a placebo-controlled , single-blind study we aimed to clarify if both peptides act by altering central chemosensitivity . 
Two subsequent C_D002245-rebreathing tests were performed in healthy young volunteers . 
During the first test 0.9 % C_D012965 was given i.v . 
; during the second test 200 micrograms of hCRH ( n = 12 ) or 400 micrograms of TRH ( n = 6 ) was administered i.v . 
Nine subjects received 0.9 % C_D012965 i.v . 
during both rebreathing manoeuvres . 
The C_D002245-response curves for the two tests were compared within the same subject . 
In the hCRH group a marked parallel shift of the C_D002245-response curve to the left was observed after hCRH ( P < 0.01 ) . 
The same effect occurred following TRH but was less striking ( P = 0.05 ) . 
hCRH and TRH caused a reduction in the C_D002245 threshold . 
The C_D002245-response curves in the control group were nearly identical . 
The results indicate an additive effect of both releasing hormones on the D_D006935 ventilatory response in humans , presumably independent of central chemosensitivity .

Forty-two Chinese C_D006514 carriers were randomized to receive placebo ( 6 patients ) or C_D019259 orally in dosages of 25 mg , 100 mg , or 300 mg daily ( 12 patients for each dosage ) . 
The drug was given for 4 weeks . 
The patients were closely monitored clinically , biochemically , and serologically up to 4 weeks after drug treatment . 
All 36 patients receiving C_D019259 had a decrease in D_D006509 virus ( HBV ) DNA values of > 90 % ( P < .001 compared with placebo ) . 
Although 25 mg of C_D019259 was slightly less effective than 100 mg ( P = .011 ) and 300 mg ( P = .005 ) , it still induced 94 % suppression of HBV DNA after the fourth week of therapy . 
HBV DNA values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 weeks of cessation of therapy . 
There was no change in the D_D006509 e antigen status or in aminotransferase levels . 
No serious adverse events were observed . 
In conclusion , a 4-week course of C_D019259 was safe and effective in suppression of HBV DNA in Chinese C_D006514 carriers . 
The suppression was > 90 % but reversible . 
Studies with long-term C_D019259 administration should be performed to determine if prolonged suppression of HBV DNA can be achieved .

title : Population-based study of risk of D_D054556 associated with various C_D003276 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Four studies published since December , 1995 , reported that the incidence of D_D054556 ( D_D054556 ) was higher in women who used C_D003276 ( C_D003276 ) containing the third-generation C_D011374 C_C033273 or C_D017135 than in users of C_D003276 containing second-generation C_D011374 . 
However , confounding and bias in the design of these studies may have affected the findings . 
The aim of our study was to re-examine the association between risk of D_D054556 and C_D003276 use with a different study design and analysis to avoid some of the bias and confounding of the earlier studies . 
METHODS : We used computer records of patients from 143 general practices in the UK . 
The study was based on the medical records of about 540,000 women born between 1941 and 1981 . 
All women who had a recorded diagnosis of D_D020246 , D_D020246 not otherwise specified , or pulmonary embolus during the study period , and who had been treated with an anticoagulant were identified as potential cases of D_D054556 . 
We did a cohort analysis to estimate and compare incidence of D_D054556 in users of the main C_D003276 preparations , and a nested case-control study to calculate the odds ratios of D_D054556 associated with use of different types of C_D003276 , after adjustment for potential confounding factors . 
In the case-control study , we matched cases to controls by exact year of birth , practice , and current use of C_D003276 . 
We used a multiple logistic regression model that included body-mass index , number of cycles , change in type of C_D003276 prescribed within 3 months of the event , previous pregnancy , and concurrent disease . 
FINDINGS : 85 women met the inclusion criteria for D_D054556 , two of whom were users of C_D011372-only C_D003276 . 
Of the 83 cases of D_D054556 associated with use of combined C_D003276 , 43 were recorded as D_D020246 , 35 as pulmonary D_D013927 , and five as D_D020246 not otherwise specified . 
The crude rate of D_D054556 per 10,000 woman-years was 4.10 in current users of any C_D003276 , 3.10 in users of second-generation C_D003276 , and 4.96 in users of third-generation preparations . 
After adjustment for age , the rate ratio of D_D054556 in users of third-generation relative to second-generation C_D003276 was 1.68 ( 95 % CI 1.04-2.75 ) . 
Logistic regression showed no significant difference in the risk of D_D054556 between users of third-generation and second-generation C_D003276 . 
Among users of third-generation C_D011374 , the risk of D_D054556 was higher in users of C_D017135 with 20 g C_D004997 than in users of C_C033273 or C_D017135 with 30 g C_D004997 . 
With all second-generation C_D003276 as the reference , the odds ratios for D_D054556 were 3.49 ( 1.21-10.12 ) for C_D017135 plus 20 g C_D004997 and 1.18 ( 0.66-2.17 ) for the other third-generation C_D011374 . 
INTERPRETATION : The previously reported increase in odds ratio associated with third-generation C_D003276 when compared with second-generation products is likely to have been the result of residual confounding by age . 
The increased odds ratio associated with products containing 20 micrograms C_D004997 and C_D017135 compared with the 30 micrograms product is biologically implausible , and is likely to be the result of preferential prescribing and , thus , confounding .

title : C_D016291 augments C_D010862-induced electrographic D_D012640 but protects against D_D001930 in rats . 
abstract : 1 . 
The authors examined the anticonvulsant effects of C_D016291 on the C_D010862-induced D_D012640 model . 
Intraperitoneal injection of C_D010862 ( 400 mg/kg ) induced tonic and clonic D_D012640 . 
C_D012601 ( 10 mg/kg ) and C_D010424 ( 5 mg/kg ) prevented development of C_D010862-induced behavioral D_D012640 but C_D016291 ( 0.5 mg/kg ) did not . 
2 . 
An electrical D_D012640 measured with hippocampal EEG appeared in the C_D010862-treated group . 
C_D012601 and C_D010424 blocked the C_D010862-induced electrographic D_D012640 , C_D016291 treatment augmented the electrographic D_D012640 induced by C_D010862 . 
3 . 
D_D001930 was assessed by examining the hippocampus microscopically . 
C_D010862 produced D_D009410 in the hippocampus , which showed pyknotic changes . 
C_D010424 , C_D012601 and C_D016291 protected the D_D001930 by C_D010862 , though in the C_D016291-treated group , the pyramidal cells of hippocampus appeared darker than normal . 
In all treatments , granule cells of the dentate gyrus were not affected . 
4 . 
These results indicate that D_D013226 induced by C_D010862 is initiated by cholinergic overstimulation and propagated by glutamatergic transmission , the elevation of which may cause D_D001930 through an excitatory C_D016202 receptor-mediated mechanism .

title : C_D017239 , C_D005472 , and C_D002955 in metastatic D_D001943 : BRE-26 , a phase II trial . 
abstract : C_D005472 plus C_D002955 and C_D017239 ( C_D017239 ; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company , Princeton , NJ ) are effective salvage therapies for metastatic D_D001943 patients . 
C_D017239 and C_D005472 have additive D_D064420 in MCF-7 cell lines . 
We performed a phase II trial of C_D017239 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours on day I followed by C_D002955 300 mg over 1 hour before C_D005472 350 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3 every 28 days ( TFL ) in women with metastatic D_D001943 . 
Analysis is reported on 37 patients with a minimum of 6 months follow-up who received a total of 192 cycles of TFL : nine cycles ( 5 % ) were associated with grade 3/4 D_D009503 requiring hospitalization ; seven ( 4 % ) cycles in two patients required C_D016179 due to D_D009503 ; no patient required platelet transfusions . 
Grade 3/4 nonhematologic D_D064420 were uncommon . 
Among the 34 patients evaluable for response , there were three complete responses ( 9 % ) and 18 partial responses ( 53 % ) for an overall response rate of 62 % . 
Of the 19 evaluable patients with prior C_D004317 exposure , 11 ( 58 % ) responded compared with nine of 15 ( 60 % ) without prior C_D004317 . 
Plasma C_D017239 concentrations were measured at the completion of C_D017239 infusion and at 24 hours in 19 patients . 
TFL is an active , well-tolerated regimen in metastatic D_D001943 .

title : Efficacy and D_-1 with the use of C_D013015 for sustained D_D017180 . 
abstract : This study prospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy , the incidence of D_D016171 , and the presumable risk factors for D_D016171 in patients treated with C_D013015 for sustained D_D017180 . 
Eighty-one consecutive patients ( 54 with D_D003324 , and 20 with D_D002311 ) with inducible sustained D_D017180 or D_D014693 received oral C_D013015 to prevent induction of the D_D017180 . 
During oral loading with C_D013015 , continuous electrocardiographic ( ECG ) monitoring was performed . 
Those patients in whom C_D013015 prevented induction of D_D017180 or D_D014693 were discharged with the drug and followed up on an outpatient basis for 21 +/- 18 months . 
Induction of the D_D017180 was prevented by oral C_D013015 in 35 ( 43 % ) patients ; the D_D017180 remained inducible in 40 ( 49 % ) patients ; and two ( 2.5 % ) patients did not tolerate even 40 mg of C_D013015 once daily . 
Four ( 5 % ) patients had from D_D016171 during the initial oral treatment with C_D013015 . 
Neither ECG [ sinus-cycle length ( SCL ) , QT or QTc interval , or U wave ] nor clinical parameters identified patients at risk for D_D016171 . 
However , the oral dose of C_D013015 was significantly lower in patients with D_D016171 ( 200 +/- 46 vs. 328 +/- 53 mg/day ; p = 0.0017 ) . 
Risk factors associated with the development of D_D016171 were the appearance of an U wave ( p = 0.049 ) , female gender ( p = 0.015 ) , and significant dose-corrected changes of SCL , QT interval , and QTc interval ( p < 0.05 ) . 
During follow-up , seven ( 20 % ) patients had a nonfatal D_D017180 recurrence , and two ( 6 % ) patients died suddenly . 
One female patient with stable D_D006331 had recurrent D_D016171 after 2 years of successful treatment with C_D013015 . 
D_D016171 occurred early during treatment even with low doses of oral C_D013015 . 
Pronounced changes in the surface ECG ( cycle length , QT , and QTc ) in relation to the dose of oral C_D013015 might identify a subgroup of patients with an increased risk for D_D016171 . 
Other ECG parameters before the application of C_D013015 did not identify patients at increased risk for D_D016171 . 
Recurrence rates of D_D017180 are high despite complete suppression of the D_D001145 during programmed stimulation . 
Therefore programmed electrical stimulation in the case of C_D013015 seems to be of limited prognostic value .

title : Chronic D_D006966 and changes in C_D004298 neurons . 
abstract : The tuberoinfundibular C_D004298rgic ( TIC_D004298 ) system is known to inhibit prolactin ( PRL ) secretion . 
In young animals this system responds to acute elevations in serum PRL by increasing its activity . 
However , this responsiveness is lost in aging rats with chronically high serum PRL levels . 
The purpose of this study was to induce D_D006966 in rats for extended periods of time and examine its effects on C_D004298rgic systems in the brain . 
D_D006966 was induced by treatment with C_D006220 , a C_D004298 receptor antagonist , and Palkovits ' microdissection technique in combination with high-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure neurotransmitter concentrations in several areas of the brain . 
After 6 months of D_D006966 , C_D004298 ( C_D004298 ) concentrations in the median eminence ( ME ) increased by 84 % over the control group . 
Nine months of D_D006966 produced a 50 % increase in C_D004298 concentrations in the ME over the control group . 
However , C_D004298 response was lost if a 9-month long C_D006220-induced D_D006966 was followed by a 1 1/2 month-long extremely high increase in serum PRL levels produced by implantation of MMQ cells under the kidney capsule . 
There was no change in the levels of C_D004298 , C_D009638 ( C_D009638 ) , C_D012701 ( C_D012701 ) , or their metabolites in the arcuate nucleus ( AN ) , medial preoptic area ( MPA ) , caudate putamen ( CP ) , substantia nigra ( SN ) , and zona incerta ( ZI ) , except for a decrease in C_D006897 ( C_D006897 ) in the AN after 6-months of D_D006966 and an increase in C_D004298 concentrations in the AN after 9-months of D_D006966 . 
These results demonstrate that D_D006966 specifically affects TIC_D004298 neurons and these effects vary , depending on the duration and intensity of D_D006966 . 
The age-related decrease in hypothalamic C_D004298 function may be associated with increases in PRL secretion .

abstract : This report describes unique contrast enhancement of the white matter on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of two patients with disseminated necrotizing D_D056784 , which developed from D_D054198 treated with high-dose C_D008727 . 
In both patients , the enhancement was more pronounced near the base of the brain than at the vertex . 
Necropsy of the first case revealed D_D003711 and D_D009336 of the white matter .

title : D_D013927 complications in D_D015473 during C_D014212 therapy . 
abstract : A case of D_D058186 , due to D_-1 in a patient with D_D015473 ( D_D015473 ) treated with C_D014212 ( C_D014212 ) and C_D014148 has been described recently . 
We report a case of D_D058186 in an D_D015473 patient treated with C_D014212 alone . 
This case further supports the concern about D_D013923 complications associated with C_D014212 therapy in D_D015473 patients . 
The patients , a 43-year-old man , presented all the signs and symptoms of D_D015473 and was included in a treatment protocol with C_D014212 . 
After 10 days of treatment , he developed D_D058186 that was completely reversible after complete remission of D_D015473 was achieved and therapy discontinued . 
We conclude that C_D014212 is a valid therapeutic choice for patients with D_D015473 , although the procoagulant tendency is not completely corrected . 
D_D013927 events , however , could be avoided by using low-dose C_D006493 .

title : Pupillary changes associated with the development of stimulant-induced D_D001714 : a case report . 
abstract : A 30-year-old C_D003042-dependent man who was a subject in a study evaluating the anticraving efficacy of the stimulant medication C_D004053 ( C_D004053 ) became D_D001714 during his second week on the study drug . 
Pupillometric changes while on C_D004053 , especially changes in the total power of D_D011681 , were dramatically different than those observed in the eight other study subjects who did not become D_D001714 . 
The large changes in total power of D_D011681 occurred a few days before the patient became fully D_D001714 . 
Such medication-associated changes in the total power of D_D011681 might be of utility in identifying persons at risk for D_D001714-like adverse effects during the medical use of psychomotor stimulants or sympathomimetic agents .

title : The negative mucosal potential : separating central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs in man . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : We wanted to test whether assessment of both a central D_D010146-related signal ( chemo-somatosensory evoked potential , CSSEP ) and a concomitantly recorded peripheral signal ( negative mucosal potential , NMP ) allows for separation of central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs . 
For this purpose , experimental conditions were created in which NSAIDs had previously been observed to produce effects on phasic and tonic D_D010146 by either central or peripheral mechanisms . 
METHODS : According to a double-blind , randomised , controlled , threefold cross-over design , 18 healthy subjects ( 11 males , 7 females ; mean age 26 years ) received either placebo , 400 mg C_D007052 , or 800 mg C_D007052 . 
Phasic D_D010146 was applied by means of short pulses of C_D002245 to the nasal mucosa ( stimulus duration 500 ms , interval approximately 60 s ) , and tonic D_D010146 was induced in the nasal cavity by means of dry air of controlled temperature , humidity and flow rate ( 22 degrees C , 0 % relative humidity , 145 ml.s-1 ) . 
Both CSSEPs as central and NMPs as peripheral correlates of D_D010146 were obtained in response to the C_D002245 stimuli . 
Additionally , the subjects rated the intensity of both phasic and tonic D_D010146 by means of visual analogue scales . 
RESULTS : As described earlier , administration of C_D007052 was followed by a decrease in tonic D_D010146 but-relative to placebo-an increase in correlates of phasic D_D010146 , indicating a specific effect of C_D007052 on the interaction between the D_D010146 stimuli under these special experimental conditions . 
Based on the similar behaviour of CSSEP and NMP , it was concluded that the pharmacological process underlying this phenomenon was localised in the periphery . 
By means of the simultaneous recording of interrelated peripheral and central electrophysiologic correlates of nociception , it was possible to separate central and peripheral effects of an NSAID . 
The major advantage of this D_D010146 model is the possibility of obtaining peripheral D_D010146-related activity directly using a non-invasive technique in humans .

title : Acute severe D_D003866 following peri-operative C_D017294 . 
abstract : A 41-year-old woman with a strong history of D_D020250 presented for abdominal hysterectomy 3 months after a previous anaesthetic where C_D017294 prophylaxis had been used . 
She had developed a severe acute major D_D003866 disorder almost immediately thereafter , possibly related to the use of a C_D012701 antagonist . 
Nine years before she had experienced a self-limited puerperal D_D003866 . 
Anaesthesia with a C_D015742 infusion and avoidance of C_D012701 antagonists provided a D_D009325-free postoperative course without exacerbation of the D_D003866 disorder .

Forty matched pairs of patients with D_D001249 are compared . 
CNA was administered for a mean of 11 +/- 10 hr . 
The incidence of D_D001145 was similar between groups . 
Symptomatic D_D007008 did not occur . 
CNA patients had higher heart rates during treatment , which may reflect severity of illness . 
The incidence of intubation was similar . 
We conclude that CNA and INA demonstrated similar profiles with regard to safety , morbidity , and mortality .

He gave a five-year history of D_D011141 and D_D059606 , during which time urinalysis had been negative for C_D005947 . 
After recovery from D_-1 , he remained D_D011141 despite normal blood C_D005947 concentrations ; water deprivation testing indicated D_D018500 , likely to be C_D008094-induced . 
We hypothesize that when this man developed D_D003924 , chronic D_D011141 due to D_D018500 was sufficient to precipitate hyperosmolar D_D003681 .

title : Effects of the intracoronary infusion of C_D003042 on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in humans . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : In dogs , a large amount of intravenous C_D003042 causes a profound D_D018487 and an increase in LV end-diastolic pressure . 
This study was done to assess the influence of a high intracoronary C_D003042 concentration on LV systolic and diastolic function in humans . 
METHODS AND RESULTS : In 20 patients ( 14 men and 6 women aged 39 to 72 years ) referred for cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of D_D002637 , we measured heart rate , systemic arterial pressure , LV pressure and its first derivative ( dP/dt ) , and LV volumes and ejection fraction before and during the final 2 to 3 minutes of a 15-minute intracoronary infusion of saline ( n=10 , control subjects ) or C_D003042 hydrochloride 1 mg/min ( n=10 ) . 
No variable changed with saline . 
With C_D003042 , the drug concentration in blood obtained from the coronary sinus was 3.0+/-0.4 ( mean+/-SD ) mg/L , similar in magnitude to the blood C_D003042 concentration reported in abusers dying of C_D003042 intoxication . 
C_D003042 induced no significant change in heart rate , LV dP/dt ( positive or negative ) , or LV end-diastolic volume , but it caused an increase in systolic and mean arterial pressures , LV end-diastolic pressure , and LV end-systolic volume , as well as a decrease in LV ejection fraction . 
CONCLUSIONS : In humans , the intracoronary infusion of C_D003042 sufficient in amount to achieve a high drug concentration in coronary sinus blood causes a D_D018487 .

title : Nonopaque crystal deposition causing D_D014517 in patients with HIV undergoing C_D019469 therapy . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : We describe the unique CT features of D_D014514 in six D_D015658 patients receiving C_D019469 , the most commonly used HIV protease inhibitor , which is associated with an increased incidence of D_D052878 . 
CONCLUSION : D_D014517 caused by precipitated C_D019469 crystals may be difficult to diagnose with unenhanced CT . 
The calculi are not opaque , and secondary signs of obstruction may be absent or minimal and should be sought carefully . 
Images may need to be obtained using i.v . 
contrast material to enable diagnosis of ureteric stones or obstruction in patients with D_D015658 who receive C_D019469 therapy .

title : D_D017091 and C_D018170 use . 
abstract : C_D018170 , a C_D012701-1 ( C_D012701-1 ) receptor agonist , is an antiD_D008881 drug that is reported to act by selectively constricting intracranial arteries . 
Recently , vasopressor responses that are distinct from the cranial circulation have been demonstrated to occur in the systemic , pulmonary , and coronary circulations . 
Cases have been published of D_D003329 , D_D017202 , and D_D009203 occurring after C_D018170 use . 
We report on the development of 8 serious cases of D_D017091 in patients with D_D008881 treated with C_D018170 .

title : Pallidotomy with the gamma knife : a positive experience . 
abstract : 51 patients with medically refractory D_D010300 underwent stereotactic posteromedial pallidotomy between August 1993 and February 1997 for treatment of D_D018476 , D_D009127 , and C_D007980-induced D_D004409 . 
In 29 patients , the pallidotomies were performed with the Leksell Gamma Knife and in 22 they were performed with the standard radiofrequency ( RF ) method . 
Clinical assessment as well as blinded ratings of Unified D_D010300 Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) scores were carried out pre- and postoperatively . 
Mean follow-up time is 20.6 months ( range 6-48 ) and all except 4 patients have been followed more than one year . 
85 percent of patients with D_D004409 were relieved of symptoms , regardless of whether the pallidotomies were performed with the Gamma Knife or radiofrequency methods . 
About 2/3 of the patients in both Gamma Knife and radiofrequency groups showed improvements in D_D018476 and D_D009127 , although when considered as a group neither the Gamma Knife nor the radiofrequency group showed statistically significant improvements in UPDRS scores . 
One patient in the Gamma Knife group ( 3.4 % ) developed a D_D006423 9 months following treatment and 5 patients ( 27.7 % ) in the radiofrequency group became transiently confused postoperatively . 
No other complications were seen . 
Gamma Knife pallidotomy is as effective as radiofrequency pallidotomy in controlling certain of the symptoms of D_D010300 . 
It may be the only practical technique available in certain patients , such as those who take anticoagulants , have D_D006470 diatheses or serious systemic medical illnesses . 
It is a viable option for other patients as well .

title : D_D009459 and C_D008774 . 
abstract : A 1-year-old female presented with D_D009459 probably caused by C_D008774 . 
She had defects in the supratentorial brain including the basal ganglia and the striatum ( D_D004678 ) due to severe perinatal D_D020925 , which was considered to be a possible predisposing factor causing D_D009459 . 
A C_D004298rgic blockade mechanism generally is accepted as the pathogenesis of this syndrome . 
However , C_D008774 is a C_D004298 agonist via the inhibition of uptake of C_D004298 , and therefore C_D004298rgic systems in the brainstem ( mainly the midbrain ) and the spinal cord were unlikely to participate in the onset of this syndrome . 
A relative C_D005680-ergic deficiency might occur because C_D003975 , a C_D005680-mimetic agent , was strikingly effective . 
This is the first reported patient with D_D009459 probably caused by C_D008774 .

title : Differential effects of C_D004997 on the neutral and acidic pathways of C_D001647 synthesis in the rat . 
abstract : Effects of C_D004997 ( C_D004997 ) on the neutral and acidic biosynthetic pathways of C_D001647 ( C_D001647 ) synthesis were evaluated in rats with an intact enterohepatic circulation and in rats with long-term bile diversion to induce C_D001647 synthesis . 
For this purpose , C_D001647 pool composition , synthesis of individual C_D001647 in vivo , hepatic activities , and expression levels of C_D002784 7alpha-hydroxylase ( CYP7A ) , and C_D013261 27-hydroxylase ( CYP27 ) , as well as of other enzymes involved in C_D001647 synthesis , were analyzed in rats treated with C_D004997 ( 5 mg/kg , 3 days ) or its vehicle . 
C_D001647 pool size was decreased by 27 % but total C_D001647 synthesis was not affected by C_D004997 in intact rats . 
Synthesis of C_D020355 was reduced by 68 % in C_D004997-treated rats , while that of chenodeoxyC_D020355 was increased by 60 % . 
The recently identified Delta22-isomer of beta-muriC_D020355 contributed for 5.4 % and 18.3 % ( P < 0.01 ) to the pool in control and C_D004997-treated rats , respectively , but could not be detected in bile after exhaustion of the pool . 
A clear reduction of C_D001647 synthesis was found in bile-diverted rats treated with C_D004997 , yet biliary C_D001647 composition was only minimally affected . 
Activity of CYP7A was decreased by C_D004997 in both intact and bile-diverted rats , whereas the activity of the CYP27 was not affected . 
Hepatic mRNA levels of CYP7A were significantly reduced by C_D004997 in bile-diverted rats only ; CYP27 mRNA levels were not affected by C_D004997 . 
In addition , mRNA levels of C_D013261 12alpha-hydroxylase and lithoC_D020355 6beta-hydroxylase were increased by bile diversion and suppressed by C_D004997 . 
This study shows that C_D004997 ( C_D004997 ) -induced D_D002780 in rats is associated with selective inhibition of the neutral pathway of C_D001647 ( C_D001647 ) synthesis . 
Simultaneous impairment of other enzymes in the C_D001647 biosynthetic pathways may contribute to overall effects of C_D004997 on C_D001647 synthesis .

title : C_D005905-sensitive D_D007022 produced by C_C040442 assessed in the rat . 
abstract : The effects of C_C040442 , a basic 35-C_D000596 peptide isolated from the venom of a lizard salivary gland , on arterial blood pressure and heart rate were examined in the rat , focusing on the possibility that activation of C_D000255 sensitive C_D011188+ ( C_D011188 ( C_D000255 ) ) channels is involved in the responses . 
The results were also compared with those of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) . 
C_C040442 produced D_D007022 in a dose-dependent manner with approximately similar potency and duration to VIP . 
D_D007022 induced by both peptides was significantly attenuated by C_D005905 , which abolished a C_D019806-produced decrease in arterial blood pressure . 
Oxyhemoglobin did not affect C_C040442-induced D_D007022 , whereas it shortened the duration of C_D000109 ( C_D000109 ) -produced D_D007022 . 
These findings suggest that C_C040442-produced D_D007022 is partly attributable to the activation of C_D005905-sensitive C_D011188+ channels ( C_D011188 ( C_D000255 ) channels ) , which presumably exist on arterial smooth muscle cells . 
EDRF ( endothelium-derived relaxing factor ) /C_D009569 does not seem to play an important role in the peptide-produced D_D007022 .

title : Long-term efficacy and adverse event of C_D009543 sustained-release tablets for C_D016572-induced D_D006973 in patients with D_D011565 . 
abstract : Thirteen D_D011565 patients with D_D006973 during the course of C_D016572 therapy were treated for 25 months with a C_D002118 channel blocker , sustained-release C_D009543 , to study the clinical antiD_D006973 effects and adverse events during treatment with both drugs . 
Seven of the 13 patients had exhibited a subclinical D_D006973 state before C_D016572 therapy . 
Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures of these 13 patients were decreased significantly after 4 weeks of C_D009543 therapy , and blood pressure was maintained within the normal range thereafter for 25 months . 
The adverse events during combined therapy with C_D016572 and C_D009543 included an increase in C_D001806 levels in 9 of the 13 patients and development of D_D005885 in 2 of the 13 patients . 
Our findings indicate that sustained-release C_D009543 is useful for D_D006973 D_D011565 patients under long-term treatment with C_D016572 , but that these patients should be monitored for D_D005885 .

title : D_D016171 D_D017180 during low dose intermittent C_D004280 treatment in a patient with D_D002311 and D_D006333 . 
abstract : The authors describe the case of a 56-year-old woman with chronic , severe D_D006333 secondary to D_D002311 and absence of significant D_D001145 who developed D_D008133 and D_D016171 D_D017180 during one cycle of intermittent low dose ( 2.5 mcg/kg per min ) C_D004280 . 
This report of D_D016171 D_D017180 during intermittent C_D004280 supports the hypothesis that unpredictable fatal D_D001145 may occur even with low doses and in patients with no history of significant rhythm disturbances . 
The mechanisms of proarrhythmic effects of C_D004280 are discussed .

title : Positive skin tests in late reactions to radiographic C_D003287 . 
abstract : In the last few years delayed reactions several hours after the injection of radiographic and C_D003287 ( C_D003287 ) have been described with increasing frequency . 
The authors report two observations on patients with delayed reactions in whom intradermoreactions ( IDR ) and patch tests to a series of ionic and non ionic C_D003287 were studied . 
After angiography by the venous route in patient n degree 1 a biphasic reaction with an immediate reaction ( D_D004417 , D_D014474 ) and delayed D_D003875 appeared , whilst patient n degree 2 developed a generalised sensation of heat , persistent D_D010146 at the site of injection immediately and a generalised macro-papular reaction after 24 hours . 
The skin tests revealed positive delayed reactions of 24 hours and 48 hours by IDR and patch tests to only some C_D003287 with common chains in their structures . 
The positive skin tests are in favour of immunological reactions and may help in diagnosis of D_D004342 in the patients .

title : Risk of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy in D_D009369 patients who received continuous infusion of C_D005472 with the complication of D_D003681 and D_D007239 . 
abstract : From 1986 to 1998 , 29 D_D009369 patients who had 32 episodes of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy related to continuous infusion of C_D005472 ( C_D005472 ) were identified . 
None of the patients had decompensated D_D008107 . 
Onset of hyperammonemic encephalopathy varied from 0.5 to 5 days ( mean : 2.6 +/- 1.3 days ) after the initiation of chemotherapy . 
Plasma C_D000644 level ranged from 248 to 2387 microg % ( mean : 626 +/- 431 microg % ) . 
Among the 32 episodes , 26 ( 81 % ) had various degrees of D_D053099 , 18 ( 56 % ) occurred during bacterial D_D007239s and 14 ( 44 % ) without D_D007239 occurred during periods of D_D003681 . 
Higher plasma C_D000644 levels and more rapid onset of D_D022124 were seen in 18 patients with bacterial D_D007239s ( p=0.003 and 0.0006 , respectively ) and in nine patients receiving high daily doses ( 2600 or 1800 mg/m2 ) of C_D005472 ( p=0.0001 and < 0.0001 , respectively ) . 
In 25 out of 32 episodes ( 78 % ) , plasma C_D000644 levels and mental status returned to normal within 2 days after adequate management . 
In conclusion , hyperammonemic encephalopathy can occur in patients receiving continuous infusion of C_D005472 . 
D_D053099 , body fluid insufficiency and bacterial D_D007239s were frequently found in these patients . 
It is therefore important to recognize this condition in patients receiving continuous infusion of C_D005472 .

title : The effects of C_D011803 and C_D015761 on conditioned place preference and changes in motor activity induced by C_D009020 in rats . 
abstract : 1 . 
The effects of two unselective C_D011188 ( C_D011188 ( + ) - ) channel blockers , C_D011803 ( 12.5 , 25 and 50 mg/kg ) and C_D015761 ( 1 and 2 mg/kg ) , on conditioned place preference and biphasic changes in motor activity induced by C_D009020 ( 10 mg/kg ) were tested in Wistar rats . 
C_D011803 is known to block voltage- , C_D002118- and C_D000255-sensitive C_D011188 ( + ) -channels while C_D015761 is known to block voltage-sensitive C_D011188 ( + ) -channels . 
2 . 
In the counterbalanced method , C_D011803 attenuated C_D009020-induced place preference , whereas C_D015761 was ineffective . 
In the motor activity test measured with an Animex-activity meter neither of the C_D011188 ( + ) -channel blockers affected C_D009020-induced D_D009069 , but both C_D011188 ( + ) -channel blockers prevented C_D009020-induced secondary D_D006948 . 
3 . 
These results suggest the involvement of C_D011803-sensitive but not C_D015761-sensitive C_D011188 ( + ) -channels in C_D009020 reward . 
It is also suggested that the blockade of C_D011188 ( + ) -channels sensitive to these blockers is not sufficient to prevent C_D009020-induced D_D009069 whereas C_D009020-induced D_D006948 seems to be connected to both C_D011803- and C_D015761-sensitive C_D011188 ( + ) -channels .

title : C_C096012/C_C096012 and C_C111148 on learning and memory impairment induced by C_D012601 in mice . 
abstract : 1 . 
C_C096012 , also known as C_C096012 , is an endogenous ligand for the orphan opioid receptor-like receptor 1 ( ORL1 ) and involves in various functions in the central nervous system ( CNS ) . 
On the other hand , C_C111148 is recently isolated from the same precursor as C_C096012 and blocks C_C096012-induced D_D006930 and D_D006930 . 
2 . 
Although ORL1 receptors which display a high degree of sequence homology with classical opioid receptors are abundant in the hippocampus , little is known regarding their role in learning and memory . 
3 . 
The present study was designed to investigate whether C_C096012/C_C096012 and C_C111148 could modulate impairment of learning and memory induced by C_D012601 , a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist , using spontaneous alternation of Y-maze and step-down type passive avoidance tasks in mice . 
4 . 
While C_C111148 ( 0.5-5.0 nmol mouse-1 , i.c.v . ) 
administered 30 min before spontaneous alternation performance or the training session of the passive avoidance task , had no effect on spontaneous alternation or passive avoidance behaviours , a lower per cent alternation and shorter median step-down latency in the retention test were obtained in C_C096012 ( 1.5 and/or 5.0 nmol mouse-1 , i.c.v . 
) -treated normal mice . 
5 . 
Administration of C_C111148 ( 1.5 and/or 5.0 nmol mouse-1 , i.c.v . ) 
30 min before spontaneous alternation performance or the training session of the passive avoidance task , attenuated the C_D012601-induced impairment of spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance behaviours . 
6 . 
These results indicated that C_C111148 , a new biologically active peptide , ameliorates impairments of spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance induced by C_D012601 , and suggested that these peptides play opposite roles in learning and memory .

abstract : We report the case of a female patient with D_D001172 who developed acute cytolytic D_D056486 due to C_C065757 . 
Recently introduced in Belgium , C_C065757 is the first nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug with selective action on the inducible form of cyclooxygenase 2 . 
The acute cytolytic D_D056486 occurred rapidly after C_C065757 administration and was associated with the development of antinuclear antibodies suggesting a D_D004342 mechanism . 
This first case of C_C065757 related D_D056486 demonstrates the potential of this drug to induce D_D056486 .

title : Induction of apoptosis by C_D017330 metabolites in HL60 and CD34+/CD19- human bone marrow progenitor cells : potential relevance to C_D017330-induced D_D000741 . 
abstract : The antipsychotic agent , C_D017330 [ C_D017330 ] has been associated with acquired D_D000741 . 
We have examined the ability of C_D017330 , three C_C032519 ring metabolites and five aromatic ring metabolites of the parent compound to induce apoptosis in HL60 cells and human bone marrow progenitor ( HBMP ) cells . 
Cells were treated for 0-24 h with each compound ( 0-200 microM ) . 
Apoptosis was assessed by fluorescence microscopy in C_C017807- and C_D011419 stained cell samples . 
Results were confirmed by determination of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation using gel electrophoresis for HL60 cell samples and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay in HBMP cells . 
The C_C034221 and C_C031927 metabolites , C_C084325 and C_C112341 , induced apoptosis in HL60 and HBMP cells in a time- and concentration dependent manner , while the C_D010636 , NCR181 , FLA873 , and C_C050313 , and the derivatives formed by oxidation of the C_C032519 ring , FLA838 , NCM001 , and NCL118 , had no effect . 
No D_D009336 was observed in cells treated with C_C084325 but C_C112341 had a biphasic effect in both cell types , inducing apoptosis at lower concentrations and D_D009336 at higher concentrations . 
These data show that the C_C034221 and C_C031927 metabolites of C_D017330 have direct toxic effects in HL60 and HBMP cells , leading to apoptosis , while the C_D019800 metabolites were inactive . 
Similarly , C_D001554-derived C_C034221 and C_C031927 , but not C_D019800 , induce apoptosis in HBMP cells [ Moran et al. , Mol . 
Pharmacol. , 50 ( 1996 ) 610-615 ] . 
We propose that C_D017330 and C_D001554 may induce D_D000741 via production of similar reactive metabolites and that the ability of C_C084325 and C_C112341 to induce apoptosis in HBMP cells may contribute to the mechanism underlying acquired D_D000741 that has been associated with C_D017330 .

title : Synthesis and preliminary pharmacological investigations of C_-1 derivatives as potential atypical antipsychotic agents in mice . 
abstract : In research towards the development of new atypical antipsychotic agents , one strategy is that the dopaminergic system can be modulated through manipulation of the serotonergic system . 
The synthesis and preliminary pharmacological evaluation of a series of potential atypical antipsychotic agents based on the structure of C_-1 ( 7 ) is described . 
Compound 7e , C_-1 , from this series showed significant affinities at the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity at the D2 receptor . 
7e exhibits a high reversal of D_D002375 induced by C_D006220 indicating its atypical antipsychotic nature .

title : Sub-chronic inhibition of C_D009569 synthesis modifies C_D006220-induced D_D002375 and the number of C_D009249-diaphorase neurons in mice . 
abstract : RATIONALE : C_D019335 ( C_D019335 ) , an inhibitor of C_D009569 synthase ( C_D009569S ) , induces D_D002375 in mice . 
This effect undergoes rapid tolerance , showing a significant decrease after 2 days of sub-chronic C_D019335 treatment . 
C_D009569 ( C_D009569 ) has been shown to influence C_D004298rgic neurotransmission in the striatum . 
Neuroleptic drugs such as C_D006220 , which block C_D004298 receptors , also cause D_D002375 in rodents . 
OBJECTIVES : To investigate the effects of subchronic C_D019335 treatment in C_D006220-induced D_D002375 and the number of C_D009569S neurons in areas related to motor control . 
METHODS : Male albino Swiss mice were treated sub-chronically ( twice a day for 4 days ) with C_D019335 ( 40 mg/kg i.p . ) 
or C_D006220 ( 1 mg/kg i.p . ) . 
D_D002375 was evaluated at the beginning and the end of the treatments . 
Reduced C_D009249-diaphorase ( C_D009249-d ) histochemistry was also employed to visualize C_D009569S as an index of enzyme expression in mice brain regions related to motor control . 
RESULTS : C_D019335 sub-chronic administration produced tolerance of C_D019335 and of C_D006220-induced D_D002375 . 
It also induced an increase in the number of C_D009249-d-positive cells in the dorsal part of the caudate and accumbens nuclei compared with C_D006220 and in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus compared with saline . 
In contrast , there was a decrease in C_D009249-d neuron number in the substantia nigra , pars compacta in both C_D006220-treated and C_D019335-treated animals . 
CONCLUSIONS : The results give further support to the hypothesis that C_D009569 plays a role in motor behavior control and suggest that it may take part in the synaptic changes produced by antipsychotic treatment .

abstract : OBJECTIVE : To determine whether pharmacological stress leads to prolonged but reversible D_D018487 in patients with D_D003324 , similar to that seen after exercise . 
DESIGN : A randomised crossover study of recovery time of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function after exercise and C_D004280 induced D_D007511 . 
SUBJECTS : 10 patients with D_D060050 , angiographically proven D_D003324 , and normal left ventricular function . 
INTERVENTIONS : Treadmill exercise and C_D004280 stress were performed on different days . 
Quantitative assessment of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function was performed using transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and at regular intervals after each test . 
RESULTS : Both forms of stress led to prolonged but reversible systolic and diastolic dysfunction . 
There was no difference in the maximum double product ( p = 0.53 ) or ST D_D003866 ( p = 0.63 ) with either form of stress . 
After exercise , ejection fraction was reduced at 15 and 30 minutes compared with baseline ( mean ( SEM ) , -5.6 ( 1.5 ) % , p < 0.05 ; and -6.1 ( 2.2 ) % , p < 0 . 
01 ) , and at 30 and 45 minutes after C_D004280 ( -10.8 ( 1.8 ) % and -5 . 
5 ( 1.8 ) % , both p < 0.01 ) . 
Regional analysis showed a reduction in the worst affected segment 15 and 30 minutes after exercise ( -27.9 ( 7.2 ) % and -28.6 ( 5.7 ) % , both p < 0.01 ) , and at 30 minutes after C_D004280 ( -32 ( 5.3 ) % , p < 0.01 ) . 
The isovolumic relaxation period was prolonged 45 minutes after each form of stress ( p < 0.05 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : In patients with D_D003324 , C_D004280 induced D_D007511 results in prolonged reversible D_D018487 , presumed to be D_D017682 , similar to that seen after exercise . 
C_D004280 induced D_D007511 could therefore be used to study the pathophysiology of this phenomenon further in patients with D_D003324 .

title : Anorexigens and D_D006976 in the United States : results from the surveillance of North American D_D006976 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : The use of appetite suppressants in Europe has been associated with the development of primary D_D006976 ( D_D006976 ) . 
Recently , C_D005277 appetite suppressants became widely used in the United States but were withdrawn in September 1997 because of concerns over adverse effects . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS : We conducted a prospective surveillance study on patients diagnosed with D_D006976 at 12 large referral centers in North America . 
Data collected on patients seen from September 1 , 1996 , to December 31 , 1997 , included the cause of the D_D006976 and its severity . 
Patients with no identifiable cause of D_D006976 were classed as D_D006976 . 
A history of drug exposure also was taken with special attention on the use of antidepressants , anorexigens , and C_D000662 . 
RESULTS : Five hundred seventy-nine patients were studied , 205 with D_D006976 and 374 with D_D006976 from other causes ( secondary D_D006976 [ SPH ] ) . 
The use of anorexigens was common in both groups . 
However , of the medications surveyed , only the C_D005277s had a significant preferential association with D_D006976 as compared with SPH ( adjusted odds ratio for use > 6 months , 7.5 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.7 to 32.4 ) . 
The association was stronger with longer duration of use when compared to shorter duration of use and was more pronounced in recent users than in remote users . 
An unexpectedly high ( 11.4 % ) number of patients with SPH had used anorexigens . 
CONCLUSION : The magnitude of the association with D_D006976 , the increase of association with increasing duration of use , and the specificity for C_D005277s are consistent with previous studies indicating that C_D005277s are causally related to D_D006976 . 
The high prevalence of anorexigen use in patients with SPH also raises the possibility that these drugs precipitate D_D006976 in patients with underlying conditions associated with SPH .

title : Clinical aspects of C_D006493-induced D_D013921 and D_D013927 and other side effects of C_D006493 therapy . 
abstract : C_D006493 , first used to prevent the clotting of blood in vitro , has been clinically used to treat D_D013927 for more than 50 years . 
Although several new anticoagulant drugs are in development , C_D006493 remains the anticoagulant of choice to treat acute D_D013927 episodes . 
The clinical effects of C_D006493 are meritorious , but side effects do exist . 
D_D006470 is the primary untoward effect of C_D006493 . 
Major D_D006470 is of primary concern in patients receiving C_D006493 therapy . 
However , additional important untoward effects of C_D006493 therapy include C_D006493-induced D_D013921 , C_D006493-associated D_D010024 , D_D004802 , D_D012871 , D_D004342 other than D_D013921 , D_D000505 , transaminasemia , D_D006947 , D_D006994 , and D_D011317 . 
These side effects are relatively rare in a given individual , but given the extremely widespread use of C_D006493 , some are quite common , particularly D_D013921|D013927 and D_D010024 . 
Although reasonable incidences of many of these side effects can be `` softly '' deduced from current reports dealing with unfractionated C_D006493 , at present the incidences of these side effects with newer low molecular weight C_D006493s appear to be much less common . 
However , only longer experience will more clearly define the incidence of each side effect with low molecular weight preparations .

title : A case of bilateral D_D009901 in a patient on C_D016559 ( C_D016559 ) therapy after liver transplantation . 
abstract : PURPOSE : To report a case of bilateral D_D009901 in a patient receiving C_D016559 ( C_D016559 , Prograf ; Fujisawa USA , Inc , Deerfield , Illinois ) for immunosuppression after orthotropic liver transplantation . 
METHOD : Case report . 
In a 58-year-old man receiving C_D016559 after orthotropic liver transplantation , serial neuro-ophthalmologic examinations and laboratory studies were performed . 
RESULTS : The patient had episodic deterioration of vision in both eyes , with clinical features resembling D_D018917 . 
D_D015354 occurred despite discontinuation of the C_D016559 . 
CONCLUSION : C_D016559 and other immunosuppressive agents may be associated with D_D009901 .

title : D_D006934 , D_D001145 , and mood stabilizers . 
abstract : Recent findings in a D_D001714 patient receiving maintenance C_D008094 therapy who developed D_D006934 and severe bradyD_D001145 prompted the authors to conduct a retrospective study of D_D001714 patients with C_D008094-associated D_D006934 . 
A printout of all cases of D_D006934 that presented during a 1-year period was generated . 
After eliminating spurious D_D006934s or those associated with intravenous fluids , the authors identified 18 non-C_D008094-treated patients with D_D006934s related to D_D009369 and other medical conditions ( group A ) and 12 patients with C_D008094-associated D_D006934 ( group B ) . 
Patients in group B were not comparable to those in group A , as the latter were medically compromised and were receiving multiple pharmacotherapies . 
Thus , two control groups were generated : group C1 , which included age- and sex-comparable C_D008094-treated D_D001714 normocalcemic patients , and group C2 , which included D_D001714 normocalcemic patients treated with anticonvulsant mood stabilizers . 
The electrocardiographic ( ECG ) findings for patients in group B were compared with those of patients in groups C1 and C2 . 
It was found that these groups did not differ in their overall frequency of ECG abnormalities ; however , there were significant differences in the frequency of conduction defects . 
Patients with D_D006934 resulting from medical diseases and D_D001714 patients with C_D008094-associated D_D006934 had significantly higher frequencies of conduction defects . 
Patients in group A had significant mortality at 2-year follow-up ( 28 % ) , in contrast to zero mortality in the other three groups . 
The clinical implications of these findings are discussed .

title : Attenuation of D_D007674 by a novel lipid nanosphere ( NS-718 ) incorporating C_D000666 . 
abstract : NS-718 , a lipid nanosphere incorporating C_D000666 , is effective against pathogenic fungi and has low D_D064420 . 
We compared the D_D064420 of NS-718 with that of C_D000666 ( C_D000666-sodium deoxycholate ; C_C059765 ) in vitro using renal cell cultures and in vivo by biochemical analysis , histopathological study of the kidney and pharmacokinetic study of C_D000666 following intravenous infusion of the formulation in rats . 
Incubation with NS-718 resulted in significantly less damage of cultured human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells compared with C_C059765 . 
Serum blood C_D014508 and C_D003404 concentrations increased significantly in rats given an iv infusion of C_C059765 3 mg/kg but not in those given the same dose of NS-718 . 
Histopathological examination of the kidney showed D_D007683 in C_C059765-treated rats but no change in NS-718-treated rats . 
C_D000666 concentrations in the kidney in NS-718-treated rats were higher than those in C_C059765-treated rats . 
Our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that incorporation of C_D000666 into lipid nanospheres of NS-718 attenuates the D_D007674 of C_D000666 .

title : Patterns of C_D013411 D_D058186 . 
abstract : C_D013411 D_D058186 is reviving specially because of its use in D_D014123 in HIV-positive patients . 
We report 4 cases , one of them in a previously healthy person . 
Under treatment with C_D013411 they developed D_D009846 , D_D015746 , D_D051437 and showed multiple radiolucent D_D007669 in echography . 
All patients recovered their previous normal renal function after adequate hydration and alcalinization . 
A nephrostomy tube had to be placed in one of the patients for D_D052878 in a single functional kidney . 
None of them needed dialysis or a renal biopsy because of a typical benign course . 
Treatment with C_D013411 requires exquisite control of renal function , an increase in water ingestion and possibly the alcalinization of the urine . 
We communicate a case in a previously healthy person , a fact not found in the recent literature . 
Probably many more cases are not detected . 
We think that a prospective study would be useful .

title : Hemodynamic and antiadrenergic effects of C_C118667 and C_D000638 in animals with a healed D_D009203 . 
abstract : The hemodynamic and antiadrenergic effects of C_C118667 , a noniodinated compound structurally related to C_D000638 , were compared with those of C_D000638 after prolonged oral administration , both at rest and during sympathetic stimulation in conscious dogs with a healed D_D009203 . 
All dogs ( n = 6 ) randomly received orally C_C118667 ( 10 and 30 mg/kg ) , C_D000638 ( 10 and 30 mg/kg ) , and placebo twice daily for 7 days , with a 3-week washout between consecutive treatments . 
Heart rate ( HR ) , mean arterial pressure ( MBP ) , positive rate of increase of left ventricular pressure ( +LVdP/dt ) , echocardiographically assessed left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , and fractional shortening ( FS ) , as well as chronotropic response to C_D007545 and exercise-induced sympathetic stimulation were evaluated under baseline and posttreatment conditions . 
Resting values of LVEF , FS , +LVdP/dt , and MBP remained unchanged whatever the drug and the dosing regimen , whereas resting HR was significantly and dose-dependently lowered after C_C118667 and to a lesser extent after C_D000638 . 
Both C_C118667 and C_D000638 significantly reduced the exercise-induced D_D013610 and , at the highest dose , decreased the C_D007545-induced D_D013610 . 
Thus , C_C118667 and C_D000638 displayed a similar level of antiadrenergic effect and did not impair the resting left ventricular function . 
Consequently , C_C118667 might be particularly suitable for the treatment and prevention of various clinical D_D001145 , without compromising the left ventricular function .

title : Phase 2 trial of liposomal C_D004317 ( 40 mg/m ( 2 ) ) in C_D010984/C_D017239-refractory ovarian and fallopian tube cancers and primary D_D010534 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Several studies have demonstrated liposomal C_D004317 ( C_D004317 ) to be an active antineoplastic agent in C_D010984-resistant D_D010051 , with dose limiting D_D064420 of the standard dosing regimen ( 50 mg/m ( 2 ) q 4 weeks ) being severe D_D060831 ( `` D_D060831 '' ) and D_D013280 . 
We wished to develop a more tolerable liposomal C_D004317 treatment regimen and document its level of activity in a well-defined patient population with C_D010984/C_D017239-refractory disease . 
METHODS AND MATERIALS : Patients with ovarian or fallopian tube cancers or primary D_D010534 with C_D010984/C_D017239-refractory disease ( stable or progressive disease following treatment with these agents or previous objective response < 3 months in duration ) were treated with liposomal C_D004317 at a dose of 40 mg/m ( 2 ) q 4 weeks . 
RESULTS : A total of 49 patients ( median age : 60 ; range 41-81 ) entered this phase 2 trial . 
The median number of prior regimens was 2 ( range : 1-6 ) . 
Six ( 12 % ) and 4 ( 8 % ) patients experienced grade 2 D_D060831 and D_D013280 , respectively ( no episodes of grade 3 ) . 
One patient developed grade 3 D_D003967 requiring hospitalization for hydration . 
Six ( 12 % ) individuals required dose reductions . 
The median number of courses of liposomal C_D004317 administered on this protocol was 2 ( range : 1-12 ) . 
Four of 44 patients ( 9 % ) evaluable for response exhibited objective and subjective evidence of an antineoplastic effect of therapy . 
CONCLUSION : This modified liposomal C_D004317 regimen results in less D_D064420 ( D_D013280 , D_D060831 ) than the standard FDA-approved dose schedule . 
Definite , although limited , antineoplastic activity is observed in patients with well-defined C_D010984- and C_D017239-refractory D_D010051 .

title : Efficacy of C_C076029 in acute D_D001714 : a double-blind , placebo-controlled study . 
The C_C076029 HGGW Study Group . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : We compared the efficacy and safety of C_C076029 vs placebo for the treatment of acute D_D001714 . 
METHODS : Four-week , randomized , double-blind , parallel study . 
A total of 115 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of D_D001714 , D_D001714 or mixed , were randomized to C_C076029 , 5 to 20 mg/d ( n = 55 ) , or placebo ( n = 60 ) . 
The primary efficacy measure was the Young-D_D001714 Rating Scale ( Y-MRS ) total score . 
Response and euthymia were defined , a priori , as at least a 50 % improvement from baseline to end point and as a score of no less than 12 at end point in the Y-MRS total score , respectively . 
Safety was assessed using adverse events , D_D001480 ( D_D001480 ) rating scales , laboratory values , electrocardiograms , vital signs , and weight change . 
RESULTS : C_C076029-treated patients demonstrated a statistically significant greater mean ( +/- SD ) improvement in Y-MRS total score than placebo-treated patients ( -14.8 +/- 12.5 and -8.1 +/- 12.7 , respectively ; P < .001 ) , which was evident at the first postbaseline observation 1 week after randomization and was maintained throughout the study ( last observation carried forward ) . 
C_C076029-treated patients demonstrated a higher rate of response ( 65 % vs 43 % , respectively ; P =.02 ) and euthymia ( 61 % vs 36 % , respectively ; P = . 
01 ) than placebo-treated patients . 
There were no statistically significant differences in D_D001480s between groups . 
However , C_C076029-treated patients had a statistically significant greater mean ( +/- SD ) D_D015430 than placebo-treated patients ( 2.1 +/- 2.8 vs 0.45 +/- 2.3 kg , respectively ) and also experienced more treatment-emergent D_D006970 ( 21 patients [ 38.2 % ] vs 5 [ 8.3 % ] , respectively ) . 
CONCLUSION : C_C076029 demonstrated greater efficacy than placebo in the treatment of acute D_D001714 and was generally well tolerated .

title : The effect of D_D015878 with C_D014331 on vision and driving simulator performance . 
abstract : PURPOSE : To assess the effect of D_D015878 on vision and driving ability . 
METHODS : A series of tests on various parameters of visual function and driving simulator performance were performed on 12 healthy drivers , before and after D_D015878 using guttae C_D014331 1 % . 
A driving simulator ( Transport Research Laboratory ) was used to measure reaction time ( RT ) , speed maintenance and steering accuracy . 
Tests of basic visual function included high- and low-contrast visual acuity ( HCVA and LCVA ) , Pelli-Robson contrast threshold ( CT ) and Goldmann perimetry ( FIELDS ) . 
Useful Field of View ( UFOV -- a test of visual attention ) was also undertaken . 
The mean differences in the pre- and post-dilatation measurements were tested for statistical significance at the 95 % level using one-tail paired t-tests . 
RESULTS : D_D015878 resulted in a statistically significant deterioration in CT and HCVA only . 
Five of 12 drivers also exhibited deterioration in LCVA , CT and RT . 
Little evidence emerged for deterioration in FIELDS and UFOV . 
Also , 7 of 12 drivers appeared to adjust their driving behaviour by reducing their speed on the driving simulator , leading to improved steering accuracy . 
CONCLUSIONS : D_D015878 may lead to a decrease in vision and daylight driving performance in young people . 
A larger study , including a broader spectrum of subjects , is warranted before guidelines can be recommended .

title : Effect of C_D008729 on maximum urethral pressure in women with genuine D_D014550 : a placebo-controlled , double-blind crossover study . 
abstract : The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role for a selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist in the treatment of urinary D_D014550 . 
A randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study design was employed . 
Half log incremental doses of intravenous C_D008729 or placebo ( saline ) were administered to a group of women with genuine D_D014550 while measuring maximum urethral pressure ( MUP ) , blood pressure , heart rate , and symptomatic side effects . 
C_D008729 evoked non-significant increases in MUP and diastolic blood pressure but caused D_D006973 and significant fall in heart rate at maximum dosage . 
Systemic side effects including piloerection , D_D006261 , and cold extremities were experienced in all subjects . 
The results indicate that the clinical usefulness of direct , peripherally acting sub-type-selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonists in the medical treatment of D_D014550 may be limited by associated piloerection and cardiovascular side effects .

title : Toleration of high doses of C_D000806 in patients with chronic D_D006333 : results from the ATLAS trial . 
The Assessment of Treatment with C_D017706 and Survival . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Treatment with C_D000806 reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic D_D006333 ( D_D006333 ) , but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials , primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents , especially at the recommended doses . 
The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high- compared with low-dose C_D017706 in D_D006333 . 
METHODS : The Assessment of C_D017706 and Survival study was a multicenter , randomized , double-blind trial in which patients with or without previous C_D000806 treatment were stabilized receiving medium-dose C_D017706 ( 12.5 or 15.0 mg once daily [ OD ] ) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high- ( 35.0 or 32.5 mg OD ) or low-dose ( 5.0 or 2.5 mg OD ) groups . 
Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV D_D006333 and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0.30 ( n = 3164 ) were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months . 
We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment , with a focus on D_D007022 and D_D007674 . 
RESULTS : Of 405 patients not previously receiving an C_D000806 , doses in only 4.2 % could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to D_D007022 ( 2.0 % ) or because of D_D007674 or D_D006947 ( 2.3 % ) . 
Doses in more than 90 % of randomized patients in the high- and low-dose groups were titrated to their assigned target , and the mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study . 
Withdrawals occurred in 27.1 % of the high- and 30.7 % of the low-dose groups . 
Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for C_D000806 intolerance ( blood pressure , < 120 mm Hg ; C_D003404 , > or =132.6 micromol/L [ > or =1.5 mg/dL ] ; age , > or =70 years ; and patients with D_D003920 ) generally tolerated the high-dose strategy . 
CONCLUSIONS : These findings demonstrate that C_D000806 therapy in most patients with D_D006333 can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses , and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted .

abstract : OBJECTIVES : Simultaneous abuse of C_D003042 and C_D000431 affects 12 million Americans annually . 
In combination , these substances are substantially more toxic than either drug alone . 
Their combined D_D066126 may be due to independent effects of each drug ; however , they may also be due to C_C066444 ( C_C066444 ) , a C_D003042 metabolite formed only in the presence of C_D000431 . 
The purpose of this study was to delineate the role of C_C066444 in the combined D_D066126 of C_D003042 and C_D000431 in a model simulating their abuse . 
METHODS : Twenty-three dogs were randomized to receive either 1 ) three intravenous ( IV ) boluses of C_D003042 7.5 mg/kg with C_D000431 ( 1 g/kg ) as an IV infusion ( C+E , n = 8 ) , 2 ) three C_D003042 boluses only ( C , n = 6 ) , 3 ) C_D000431 infusion only ( E , n = 5 ) , or 4 ) placebo boluses and infusion ( n = 4 ) . 
Hemodynamic measurements , electrocardiograms , and serum drug concentrations were obtained at baseline , and then at fixed time intervals after each drug was administered . 
RESULTS : Two of eight dogs in the C+E group experienced D_-1 . 
The most dramatic hemodynamic changes occurred after each C_D003042 bolus in the C+E and C only groups ; however , persistent hemodynamic changes occurred in the C+E group . 
Peak C_C066444 levels were associated with a 45 % ( SD +/- 22 % , 95 % CI = 22 % to 69 % ) D_D002303 ( p < 0.05 ) , a 56 % ( SD +/- 23 % , 95 % CI = 32 % to 80 % ) decrease in dP/dt ( max ) ( p < .006 ) , and a 23 % ( SD +/- 15 % , 95 % CI = 7 % to 49 % ) decrease in SVO ( 2 ) ( p < 0.025 ) . 
D_D001145 were primarily observed in the C+E group , in which four of eight dogs experienced D_D017180 . 
CONCLUSIONS : C_D003042 and C_D000431 in combination were more toxic than either substance alone . 
Co-administration resulted in prolonged D_D066126 and was dysrhythmogenic . 
Peak serum C_C066444 concentrations were associated with prolonged D_D009202 .

title : Frequency of appearance of myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( MPO-ANCA ) in D_D006111 patients treated with C_D011441 and the relationship between MPO-ANCA and clinical manifestations . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( MPO-ANCA ) -positive D_D014657 has been reported in patients with D_D006111 who were treated with C_D011441 ( C_D011441 ) . 
The appearance of MPO-ANCA in these cases was suspected of being related to C_D011441 because the titres of MPO-ANCA decreased when C_D011441 was stopped . 
Nevertheless , there have been no studies on the temporal relationship between the appearance of MPO-ANCA and D_D014657 during C_D011441 therapy , or on the incidence of MPO-ANCA in untreated D_D006111 patients . 
Therefore , we sought to address these parameters in patients with D_D006111 . 
PATIENTS : We investigated 102 untreated patients with D_D006980 due to D_D006111 for the presence of MPO-ANCA , and for the development D_D014657 after starting C_D011441 therapy . 
Twenty-nine of them were later excluded because of adverse effects of C_D011441 or because the observation period was less than 3 months . 
The remaining 73 patients ( 55 women and 18 men ) , all of whom were examined for more than 3 months , were adopted as the subjects of the investigation . 
The median observation period was 23.6 months ( range : 3-37 months ) . 
MEASUREMENTS : MPO-ANCA was measured at intervals of 2-6 months . 
RESULTS : Before treatment , the MPO-ANCA titres of all 102 untreated D_D006111 patients were within the reference range ( below 10 U/ml ) . 
Three ( 4.1 % ) of the 73 patients were positive for MPO-ANCA at 13 , 16 and 17 months , respectively , after the start of C_D011441 therapy . 
In two of them , the MPO-ANCA titres transiently increased to 12.8 and 15.0 U/ml , respectively , despite continued C_D011441 therapy , but no D_D014652 developed . 
In the third patient , the MPO-ANCA titre increased to 204 U/ml and she developed a higher D_D005334 , D_D019226 and D_D018771 , but the symptoms resolved 2 weeks after stopping C_D011441 therapy , and the MPO-ANCA titre decreased to 20.7 U/ml by 4 months after discontinuing C_D011441 . 
CONCLUSIONS : C_D011441 therapy may be related to the appearance of MPO-ANCA , but MPO-ANCA does not appear to be closely related to D_D014657 .

title : Prevalence of D_D006331 in asymptomatic chronic C_D003042 users . 
abstract : To determine the prevalence of D_D006331 in outpatient young asymptomatic chronic C_D003042 users , 35 C_D003042 users and 32 age-matched controls underwent resting and exercise electrocardiography ( ECG ) and Doppler echocardiography . 
Findings consistent with D_D003324 were detected in 12 ( 34 % ) patients and 3 ( 9 % ) controls ( p = 0.01 ) . 
Decreased left ventricular systolic function was demonstrated in 5 ( 14 % ) patients , but in none of the controls ( p = 0.055 ) . 
Finally , resting and peak exercise D_D018487 was detected in 38 and 35 % of patients as compared to 19 and 9 % of controls , respectively ( p = 0.11 and 0.02 , respectively ) . 
We conclude that coronary artery or myocardial disease is common ( 38 % ) in young asymptomatic chronic C_D003042 users . 
Therefore , screening ECG and echocardiography may be warranted in these patients .

Oral pre-treatment with PK ( 80 mg kg ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) for 15 days ) significantly prevented the C_D007545-induced D_D009203 and maintained the rats at near normal status .

title : Phase 2 early afterdepolarization as a trigger of polymorphic D_D017180 in acquired D_D008133 : direct evidence from intracellular recordings in the intact left ventricular wall . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : This study examined the role of phase 2 early afterdepolarization ( EAD ) in producing a trigger to initiate D_D016171 ( D_D016171 ) with D_D008133 induced by dl-C_D013015 and C_C086123 . 
The contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization ( TDR ) to transmural propagation of EAD and the maintenance of D_D016171 was also evaluated . 
METHODS AND RESULTS : Transmembrane action potentials from epicardium , midmyocardium , and endocardium were recorded simultaneously , together with a transmural ECG , in arterially perfused canine and rabbit left ventricular preparations . 
dl-C_D013015 preferentially prolonged action potential duration ( APD ) in M cells dose-dependently ( 1 to 100 micromol/L ) , leading to D_D008133 and an increase in TDR . 
C_C086123 , however , significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 micromol/L but shortened them at 30 micromol/L . 
Unlike dl-C_D013015 , C_C086123 ( > 3 micromol/L ) increased epicardial APD markedly , causing a diminished TDR . 
Although both dl-C_D013015 and C_C086123 rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles , they produced frequent EADs in rabbits , in which more pronounced D_D008133 was seen . 
An increase in TDR by dl-C_D013015 facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous D_D016171 in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles . 
Of note , although C_C086123 ( 3 to 10 micromol/L ) increased APD more than dl-C_D013015 , its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally , probably because of a diminished TDR . 
CONCLUSIONS : This study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular action potential recordings that phase 2 EAD can be generated from intact ventricular wall and produce a trigger to initiate the onset of D_D016171 under D_D008133 .

title : Prenatal C_D003042 exposure and cranial sonographic findings in D_D007235 . 
abstract : PURPOSE : Prenatal C_D003042 exposure has been linked with subependymal D_D006470 and the formation of D_D003560 that are detectable on cranial sonography in neonates born at term . 
We sought to determine if prenatal C_D003042 exposure increases the incidence of subependymal D_D003560 in D_D007235 . 
METHODS : We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and cranial sonograms obtained during a 1-year period on 122 D_D007235 . 
Infants were categorized into 1 of 2 groups : those exposed to C_D003042 and those not exposed to C_D003042 . 
Infants were assigned to the C_D003042-exposed group if there was a maternal history of C_D003042 abuse during pregnancy or if maternal or neonatal urine toxicology results were positive at the time of delivery . 
RESULTS : Five of the 122 infants were excluded from the study because of insufficient medical and drug histories . 
The incidence of subependymal D_D003560 in the 117 remaining infants was 14 % ( 16 of 117 ) . 
The incidence of subependymal D_D003560 in infants exposed to C_D003042 prenatally was 44 % ( 8 of 18 ) compared with 8 % ( 8 of 99 ) in the unexposed group ( p < 0.01 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : We found an increased incidence of subependymal cyst formation in D_D007235 who were exposed to C_D003042 prenatally . 
This result is consistent with results of similar studies in term infants .

title : C_D013792 D_D009422 in patients treated for metastatic D_D011471 . 
abstract : We prospectively evaluated C_D013792-induced D_D009422 using electrodiagnostic studies . 
Sixty-seven men with metastatic C_D000728-independent D_D011471 in an open-label trial of oral C_D013792 underwent neurologic examinations and nerve conduction studies ( NCS ) prior to and at 3-month intervals during treatment . 
NCS included recording of sensory nerve action potentials ( SNAPs ) from median , radial , ulnar , and sural nerves . 
SNAP amplitudes for each nerve were expressed as the percentage of its baseline , and the mean of the four was termed the SNAP index . 
A 40 % decline in the SNAP index was considered clinically significant . 
C_D013792 was discontinued in 55 patients for lack of therapeutic response . 
Of 67 patients initially enrolled , 24 remained on C_D013792 for 3 months , 8 remained at 6 months , and 3 remained at 9 months . 
Six patients developed D_D009422 . 
Clinical symptoms and a decline in the SNAP index occurred concurrently . 
Older age and cumulative dose were possible contributing factors . 
D_D009422 may thus be a common complication of C_D013792 in older patients . 
The SNAP index can be used to monitor peripheral D_D009422 , but not for early detection .

title : Overexpression of C_D003300/C_D015032-C_D013481 dismutase protects from C_D007612-induced D_D034381 . 
abstract : The participation of reactive C_D010100 species in C_D000617-induced D_D006311 has been deduced from observations that C_D000617-C_D007501 complexes catalyze the formation of C_D013481 radicals in vitro and that antioxidants attenuate D_D006311 in vivo . 
We therefore hypothesized that overexpression of C_D003300/C_D015032-C_D013481 dismutase ( h-SOD1 ) should protect transgenic mice from D_D006311 . 
Immunocytochemistry confirmed expression of h-SOD1 in inner ear tissues of transgenic C57BL/6-TgN [ SOD1 ] 3Cje mice . 
Transgenic and nontransgenic littermates received C_D007612 ( 400 mg/kg body weight/day ) for 10 days beginning on day 10 after birth . 
Auditory thresholds were tested by evoked auditory brain stem responses at 1 month after birth . 
In nontransgenic animals , the threshold in the C_D007612-treated group was 45-50 dB higher than in saline-injected controls . 
In the transgenic group , C_D007612 increased the threshold by only 15 dB over the respective controls . 
The effects were similar at 12 and 24 kHz . 
The protection by overexpression of C_D013481 dismutase supports the hypothesis that oxidant stress plays a significant role in C_D000617-induced D_D006311 . 
The results also suggest transgenic animals as suitable models to investigate the underlying mechanisms and possible strategies for prevention .

title : C_D011241 induces D_D001008 and glial cerebral changes in rats . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : To assess whether C_D011241 ( C_D011241 ) produces D_D001008 and/or cerebral glial changes in rats . 
METHODS : Male Wistar rats were studied and 3 groups were formed ( 8 rats per group ) . 
The moderate-dose group received 5 mg/kg/day C_D011241 released from a subcutaneous implant . 
In the high-dose group , implants containing C_D011241 equivalent to 60 mg/kg/day were applied . 
In the control group implants contained no C_D011241 . 
D_D001008 was assessed using an open field and elevated plus-maze devices . 
The number of cells and cytoplasmic transformation of astrocytes and microglia cells were assessed by immunohistochemical analyses . 
RESULTS : D_D001008 was documented in both groups of C_D011241 treated rats compared with controls . 
The magnitude of transformation of the microglia assessed by the number of intersections was significantly higher in the C_D011241 groups than in controls in the prefrontal cortex ( moderate-dose , 24.1 ; high-dose , 23.6 ; controls 18.7 ; p < 0.01 ) and striatum ( moderate-dose 25.6 ; high-dose 26.3 ; controls 18.9 ; p < 0.01 ) , but not in hippocampus . 
The number of stained microglia cells was significantly higher in the C_D011241 treated groups in the prefrontal cortex than in controls ( moderate-dose , 29.1 ; high-dose , 28.4 ; control , 17.7 cells per field ; p < 0.01 ) . 
Stained microglia cells were significantly more numerous striatum and hippocampus in the high-dose group compared to controls . 
CONCLUSION : Subacute exposure to C_D011241 induced D_D001008 and reactivity of microglia . 
The relevance of these features for patients using C_D011241 remains to be elucidated .

title : Phase II study of C_D016190 and liposomal C_D004317 in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : The activity of the combination of C_D016190 and liposomal C_D004317 was tested in a Phase II study of patients with recurrent D_D002583 . 
METHODS : The combination of C_D016190 ( area under the concentration curve [ AUC ] , 5 ) and liposomal C_D004317 ( C_D004317 ; starting dose , 40 mg/m ( 2 ) ) was administered intravenously every 28 days to 37 patients with recurrent squamous cell D_D002583 to determine antitumor activity and D_D064420 profile . 
RESULTS : Twenty-nine patients were assessable for response , and 35 patients were assessable for D_D064420 . 
The overall response rate was 38 % , the median time to response was 10 weeks , the median duration of response was 26 weeks , and the median survival was 37 weeks . 
The main toxic effect was D_D001855 , with Grade 3 and 4 D_D009503 in 16 patients , D_D000740 in 12 patients , D_D013921 in 11 patients , and neutropenic fever in 3 patients . 
Four patients had five infusion-related reactions during the infusion of liposomal C_D004317 , leading to treatment discontinuation in three patients . 
Grade > or = 2 nonhematologic D_D064420 included D_D009325 in 17 patients , D_D014839 in 14 patients , D_D005221 in 9 patients , D_D052016 and/or D_D013280 in 8 patients , D_D003248 in 6 patients , D_D015431 in 5 patients , D_D060831 in 2 patients , and D_D012871 in 3 patients . 
CONCLUSIONS : The combination of C_D016190 and liposomal C_D004317 has modest activity in patients with recurrent D_D002583 .

title : Antimicrobial-induced D_D001714 ( antibioD_D001714 ) : a review of spontaneous reports . 
abstract : The authors reviewed reported cases of antibiotic-induced D_D001714 episodes by means of a MEDLINE and PsychLit search for reports of antibiotic-induced D_D001714 . 
Unpublished reports were requested from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) . 
Twenty-one reports of antimicrobial-induced D_D001714 were found in the literature . 
There were 6 cases implicating C_D017291 , 13 implicating C_D007538 , and 1 case each implicating C_D004917 and C_D000658 . 
The WHO reported 82 cases . 
Of these , C_D017291 was implicated in 23 ( 27.6 % ) cases , C_D002939 in 12 ( 14.4 % ) cases , and C_D015242 in 10 ( 12 % ) cases . 
C_D015662 , C_D008795 , and C_D004917 were involved in 15 reported D_D001714 episodes . 
Cases reported by the FDA showed C_D017291 and C_D002939 to be the most frequently associated with the development of D_D001714 . 
Statistical analysis of the data would not have demonstrated a significant statistical correlative risk and was therefore not undertaken . 
Patients have an increased risk of developing D_D001714 while being treated with antimicrobials . 
Although this is not a statistically significant risk , physicians must be aware of the effect and reversibility . 
Further research clearly is required to determine the incidence of antimicrobial-induced D_D001714 , the relative risk factors of developing an antimicrobial-induced D_D001714 episode among various demographic populations , and the incidence of patients who continue to have persistent affective disorders once the initial episode , which occurs while the patient is taking antibiotics , subsides . 
The authors elected to name this syndrome `` antibioD_D001714 . ''

abstract : C_D007980-induced D_D015835 are very uncommon . 
Usually they occur simultaneously with limb peak-dose D_D002819 . 
We report on a patient with leftward and upward deviations of gaze during the peak effect of C_D007980 , and hypothesize that a severe dopaminergic denervation in the caudate nucleus is needed for the appearance of these C_D007980-induce D_D015835 .

title : A comparison of C_D005996 with C_D004008 for the treatment of primary D_D004412 : an open , randomized , cross-over trial . 
abstract : Primary D_D004412 is a syndrome characterized by D_D010146ful uterine contractility caused by a hypersecretion of endometrial C_D011453 ; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first choice for its treatment . 
However , in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that myometrial cells are also targets of the relaxant effects of C_D009569 ( C_D009569 ) . 
The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of C_D005996 ( C_D005996 ) , an C_D009569 donor , in the resolution of primary D_D004412 in comparison with C_D004008 ( C_D004008 ) . 
A total of 24 patients with the diagnosis of severe primary D_D004412 were studied during two consecutive menstrual cycles . 
In an open , cross-over , controlled design , patients were randomized to receive either C_D004008 per os or C_D005996 patches the first days of menses , when menstrual cramps became unendurable . 
In the subsequent cycle the other treatment was used . 
Patients received up to 3 doses/day of 50 mg C_D004008 or 2.5 mg/24 h transdermal C_D005996 for the first 3 days of the cycle , according to their needs . 
The participants recorded menstrual symptoms and possible side-effects at different times ( 0 , 30 , 60 , 120 minutes ) after the first dose of medication on the first day of the cycle , with both drugs . 
The difference in D_D010146 intensity score ( DPI ) was the main outcome variable . 
Both treatments significantly reduced DPI by the 30th minute ( C_D005996 , -12.8 +/- 17.9 ; C_D004008 , -18.9 +/- 16.6 ) . 
However , C_D004008 continued to be effective in reducing pelvic D_D010146 for two hours , whereas C_D005996 scores remained more or less stable after 30 min and significantly higher than those for DFC ( after one hour : C_D005996 , -12.8 +/- 17.9 ; DFC , -18.9 +/- 16.6 and after two hours : C_D005996 , -23.7 +/- 20.5 ; DFC , -59.7 +/- 17.9 , p = 0.0001 ) . 
Low back D_D010146 was also relieved by both drugs . 
D_D006261 was significantly increased by C_D005996 but not by C_D004008 . 
Eight patients stopped using C_D005996 because D_D006261 -- attributed to its use -- became intolerable . 
These findings indicate that C_D005996 has a reduced efficacy and tolerability by comparison with C_D004008 in the treatment of primary D_D004412 .

title : C_C055603 , a long-acting non-SH group C_D000809 converting enzyme inhibitor , modulates D_D007674 in chronic C_D011692 D_D009401 . 
abstract : The purpose of the present study was to determine whether chronic administration of C_C055603 , a long-acting non-SH group C_D000809 converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , reduced D_D011507 , inhibited glomerular D_D006984 and prevented D_D005921 in chronic C_D011692 ( C_D011692 ) - induced D_D009404 rats . 
D_D009401 was induced by injection of C_D011692 ( 15mg/100g body weight ) in male Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rats . 
Four groups were used , i ) the C_D011692 group ( 14 ) , ii ) C_D011692/C_C055603 ( 13 ) , iii ) C_C055603 ( 14 ) and iv ) untreated controls ( 15 ) . 
C_C055603 ( 8 mg/kg/day ) was administered to the rats which were killed at weeks 4 , 14 or 20 . 
At each time point , systolic blood pressure ( BP ) , urinary protein excretion and renal histopathological findings were evaluated , and morphometric image analysis was done . 
Systolic BP in the C_D011692 group was significantly high at 4 , 14 and 20 weeks , but was normal in the C_D011692/C_C055603 group . 
Urinary protein excretion in the C_D011692 group increased significantly , peaking at 8 days , then decreased at 4 weeks , but rose again significantly at 14 and 20 weeks . 
C_C055603 did not attenuate D_D011507 at 8 days , but it did markedly lower it from weeks 4 to 20 . 
The D_D005921 index ( GSI ) was 6.21 % at 4 weeks and respectively 25.35 % and 30.49 % at 14 and 20 weeks in the C_D011692 group . 
There was a significant correlation between urinary protein excretion and GSI ( r = 0.808 , p < 0.0001 ) . 
The ratio of glomerular tuft area to the area of Bowman 's capsules ( GT/BC ) in the C_D011692 group was significantly increased , but it was significantly lower in the C_D011692/C_C055603 group . 
It appears that C_C055603 was effective in retarding renal progression and protected renal function in C_D011692 D_D009401 rats .

title : D_D006976 after C_D007052 prophylaxis in very preterm infants . 
abstract : We report three cases of severe D_D000860 after C_D007052 administration during a randomised controlled trial of prophylactic treatment of D_D004374 with C_D007052 in premature infants born at less than 28 weeks of gestation . 
Echocardiography showed severely decreased pulmonary blood flow . 
D_D000860 resolved quickly on inhaled C_D009569 therapy . 
We suggest that investigators involved in similar trials pay close attention to pulmonary pressure if D_D000860 occurs after prophylactic administration of C_D007052 .

title : D_D007010 and D_D007177 reported with the use of C_D014750 : an over-representation of Asians ? 
abstract : PURPOSE : This retrospective study used a pharmaceutical company 's global safety database to determine the reporting rate of D_D007010 and/or D_D007177 ( D_D007177 ) among C_D014750-treated patients and to explore the possibility of at-risk population subgroups . 
METHOD : We searched the Eli Lilly and Company 's computerized adverse event database for all reported cases of D_D007010 and/or D_D007177 as of 1 November 1999 that had been reported during the use of C_D014750 . 
RESULTS : A total of 76 cases of D_D007010 and/or D_D007177 associated with C_D014750 use were identified . 
The overall reporting rate was estimated to be 1.3/100,000 treated patients . 
The average age of patients was 35.6 +/- 28.3 years , and 62 % were males . 
Approximately 75 % of the patients were receiving treatment for D_D007938 or D_D008223 . 
Among the 39 reports that included information on race , the racial distribution was : 1 Black , 3 Caucasian , and 35 Asian . 
CONCLUSION : Our data suggest that Asian patients may be at increased risk of D_D007010 and/or D_D007177 associated with C_D014750 use . 
Although the overall reported rate of D_D007177 associated with C_D014750 is very low , physicians caring for Asian oncology patients should be aware of this potential serious but reversible adverse event .

title : Delayed D_D064420 of C_D003520 on the bladder of DBA/2 and C57BL/6 female mouse . 
abstract : The present study describes the delayed development of a severe bladder pathology in a susceptible strain of mice ( DBA/2 ) but not in a resistant strain ( C57BL/6 ) when both were treated with a single 300 mg/kg dose of C_D003520 ( C_D003520 ) . 
Inbred DBA/2 and C57BL/6 female mice were injected with C_D003520 , and the effect of the drug on the bladder was assessed during 100 days by light microscopy using different staining procedures , and after 30 days by conventional electron microscopy . 
Early C_D003520 D_D064420 caused a typical D_D006470 D_D003556 in both strains that was completely repaired in about 7-10 days . 
After 30 days of C_D003520 injection ulcerous and non-ulcerous forms of chronic D_D003556 appeared in 86 % of DBA/2 mice but only in 4 % of C57BL/6 mice . 
Delayed D_D003556 was characterized by infiltration and transepithelial passage into the lumen of inflammatory cells and by frequent exfoliation of the urothelium . 
Mast cells appeared in the connective and muscular layers of the bladder at a much higher number in DBA/2 mice than in C57BL/6 mice or untreated controls . 
Electron microscopy disclosed the absence of the typical discoidal vesicles normally present in the cytoplasm of surface cells . 
Instead , numerous abnormal vesicles containing one or several dark granules were observed in the cytoplasm of cells from all the epithelial layers . 
Delayed D_D003556 still persisted in DBA/2 mice 100 days after treatment . 
These results indicate that delayed D_D064420 of C_D003520 in female DBA/2 mice causes a bladder pathology that is not observed in C57BL/6 mice . 
This pathology resembles interstitial D_D003556 in humans and could perhaps be used as an animal model for studies on the disease .

title : High-dose C_D005472 / C_D002955 in combination with three-weekly C_D016685 in the treatment of advanced D_D013274 . 
A phase II study . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : The 24-hour continuous infusion of C_D005472 ( C_D005472 ) and C_D002955 ( C_D002955 ) as part of several new multidrug chemotherapy regimens in advanced D_D013274 ( D_D013274 ) has shown to be effective , with low D_D064420 . 
In a previous phase II study with 3-weekly bolus C_D005472 , C_D002955 and C_D016685 ( C_D016685 ) we found a low D_D064420 rate and response rates comparable to those of regimens such as ELF , C_D002955M or C_D002955MTX , and a promising median overall survival . 
In order to improve this C_D016685-dependent schedule we initiated a phase II study with high-dose C_D005472/C_D002955 and 3-weekly bolus C_D016685 . 
PATIENTS AND METHODS : From February , 1998 to September , 2000 we recruited 33 patients with D_D013274 to receive weekly 24-hour C_D005472 2,600 mg/m ( 2 ) preceded by 2-hour C_D002955 500 mg/m ( 2 ) for 6 weeks , followed by a 2-week rest period . 
Bolus C_D016685 10 mg/m ( 2 ) was added in 3-weekly intervals . 
Treatment given on an outpatient basis , using portable pump systems , was repeated on day 57 . 
Patients ' characteristics were : male/female ratio 20/13 ; median age 57 ( 27-75 ) years ; median WHO status 1 ( 0-2 ) . 
18 patients had a primary D_D013274 , and 15 showed a relapsed D_D013274 . 
Median follow-up was 11.8 months ( range of those surviving : 2.7-11.8 months ) . 
RESULTS : 32 patients were evaluable for response - complete remission 9.1 % ( n = 3 ) , partial remission 45.5 % ( n = 15 ) , no change 27.3 % ( n = 9 ) , progressive disease 15.1 % ( n = 5 ) . 
Median overall survival time was 10.2 months [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 8.7-11.6 ] , and median progression-free survival time was 7.6 months ( 95 % CI : 4.4-10.9 ) . 
The worst D_D064420 ( % ) observed were ( CTC-NCI 1/2/3 ) : D_D007970 45.5/18.2/6.1 , D_D013921 33.3/9.1/6.1 , D_D014839 24.2/9.1/0 , D_D003967 36.4/6.1/3.0 , D_D013280 18.2/9.1/0 , D_D060831 12.1/0/0 . 
Two patients developed D_D006463 ( D_D006463 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : High-dose C_D005472/C_D002955/C_D016685 is an effective and well-tolerated outpatient regimen for D_D013274 ( objective response rate 54.6 % ) . 
It may serve as an alternative to C_D002945-containing regimens ; however , it has to be considered that possibly D_D006463 may occur .

title : Persistent sterile D_-1 is associated with D_D007674 in D_D015658 children treated with C_D019469 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Prolonged administration of C_D019469 is associated with the occurrence of a variety of renal complications in adults . 
These well-documented side effects have restricted the use of this potent protease inhibitor in children . 
DESIGN : A prospective study to monitor C_D019469-related D_D007674 in a cohort of 30 D_D015658 children treated with C_D019469 . 
METHODS : Urinary pH , albumin , C_D003404 , the presence of erythrocytes , leukocytes , bacteria and crystals , and culture were analyzed every 3 months for 96 weeks . 
Serum C_D003404 levels were routinely determined at the same time points . 
Steady-state pharmacokinetics of C_D019469 were done at week 4 after the initiation of C_D019469 . 
RESULTS : The cumulative incidence of persistent sterile D_-1 ( > or =75 cells/ micro L in at least 2 consecutive visits ) after 96 weeks was 53 % . 
Persistent sterile D_-1 was frequently associated with a mild increase in the urine albumin/C_D003404 ratio and by microscopic D_D006417 . 
The cumulative incidence of serum C_D003404 levels > 50 % above normal was 33 % after 96 weeks . 
Children with persistent sterile D_-1 more frequently had serum C_D003404 levels of 50 % above normal than those children without persistent sterile D_-1 . 
In children younger than 5.6 years , persistent sterile D_-1 was significantly more frequent than in older children . 
A higher cumulative incidence of persistent D_-1 was found in children with an area under the curve > 19 mg/L x h or a peak serum level of C_D019469 > 12 mg/L . 
In 4 children , C_D019469 was discontinued because of D_D007674 . 
Subsequently , the serum C_D003404 levels decreased , the urine albumin/C_D003404 ratios returned to zero , and the D_-1 disappeared within 3 months . 
CONCLUSIONS : Children treated with C_D019469 have a high cumulative incidence of persistent sterile D_-1 . 
Children with persistent sterile D_-1 more frequently had an increase in serum C_D003404 levels of > 50 % above normal . 
Younger children have an additional risk for renal complications . 
The D_D007674 in these children occurred in the absence of clinical symptoms of D_D053040 . 
C_D019469-associated D_D007674 must be monitored closely , especially in children with risk factors such as persistent sterile D_-1 , age < 5.6 years , an area under the curve of C_D019469 > 19 mg/L x h , and a C ( max ) > 12 mg/L .

title : Utility of troponin I in patients with C_D003042-associated D_D002637 . 
abstract : Baseline electrocardiogram abnormalities and market elevations not associated with D_D009202 make accurate diagnosis of D_D009203 ( D_D009203 ) difficult in patients with C_D003042-associated D_D002637 . 
Troponin sampling may offer greater diagnostic utility in these patients . 
OBJECTIVE : To assess outcomes based on troponin positivity in patients with C_D003042 D_D002637 admitted for exclusion of D_D009203 . 
METHODS : Outcomes were examined in patients admitted for possible D_D009203 after C_D003042 use . 
All patients underwent a rapid rule-in protocol that included serial sampling of C_D003401 kinase ( CK ) , CK-MB , and cardiac troponin I ( cTnI ) over eight hours . 
Outcomes included CK-MB D_D009203 ( CK-MB > or= 8 ng/mL with a relative index [ ( CK-MB x 100 ) /total CK ] > or= 4 , D_D003643 , and significant D_D003327 ( > or=50 % ) . 
RESULTS : Of the 246 admitted patients , 34 ( 14 % ) met CK-MB criteria for D_D009203 and 38 ( 16 % ) had cTnI elevations . 
Angiography was performed in 29 of 38 patients who were cTnI-positive , with significant disease present in 25 ( 86 % ) . 
Three of the four patients without significant disease who had cTnI elevations met CK-MB criteria for D_D009203 , and the other had a peak CK-MB level of 13 ng/mL . 
Sensitivities , specificities , and positive and negative likelihood ratios for predicting D_D003643 or significant disease were high for both CK-MB D_D009203 and cTnI and were not significantly different . 
CONCLUSIONS : Most patients with cTnI elevations meet CK-MB criteria for D_D009203 , as well as have a high incidence of underlying significant disease . 
Troponin appears to have an equivalent diagnostic accuracy compared with CK-MB for diagnosing D_D009336 in patients with C_D003042-associated D_D002637 and suspected D_D009203 .

title : Acute D_D009395 due to C_D009530 ( C_D009530 ) . 
abstract : We report a case of acute D_D009395 ( D_D009395 ) due to C_D009530 ( C_D009530 ) . 
A 50-year-old patient admitted to our hospital for D_D005334 and D_D058186 . 
Before admission , he had been taking C_D009530 and C_C036067 due to D_D012170 at ophthalmologic department . 
Thereafter , he experienced intermittent D_D005334 and D_D005076 . 
On admission , clinical symptoms ( i.e . 
D_D018771 and D_D005334 ) and laboratory findings ( i.e . 
D_D004802 and D_D051437 ) suggested D_D009395 , and which was confirmed by pathologic findings on renal biopsy . 
A lymphocyte transformation test demonstrated a positive result against C_D009530 . 
Treatment was consisted of withdrawal of C_D009530 and intravenous C_D008775 , and his renal function was completely recovered . 
To our knowledge , this is the first report of C_D009530-associated D_D009395 .

title : Blood brain barrier in right- and left-pawed female rats assessed by a new staining method . 
abstract : The asymmetrical breakdown of the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) was studied in female rats . 
Paw preference was assessed by a food reaching test . 
C_D004837-induced D_D006973 was used to destroy the BBB , which was evaluated using C_C009591 ( C_C009591 ) staining of the brain slices just after giving C_D004837 for 30 s. In normal rats , the whole brain sections exhibited complete staining with C_C009591 . 
After C_D004837 infusion for 30 s , there were large unstained areas in the left brain in right-pawed animals , and vice versa in left-pawed animals . 
Similar results were obtained in D_D012640-induced breakdown of BBB . 
These results were explained by an asymmetric cerebral blood flow depending upon the paw preference in rats . 
It was suggested that this new method and the results are consistent with contralateral motor control that may be important in determining the dominant cerebral hemisphere in animals .

title : C_C043211 protects against C_D004317-induced mitochondrial D_D009202 . 
abstract : Several cytopathic mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the dose-limiting cumulative and irreversible D_D009202 caused by C_D004317 . 
Recent evidence indicates that oxidative stress and D_D028361 are key factors in the pathogenic process . 
The objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that C_C043211 , a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with potent antioxidant properties , protects against the cardiac and hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction associated with subchronic C_D004317 D_D064420 . 
Heart and liver mitochondria were isolated from rats treated for 7 weeks with C_D004317 ( 2 mg/kg sc/week ) , C_C043211 ( 1 mg/kg ip/week ) , or the combination of the two drugs . 
Heart mitochondria isolated from C_D004317-treated rats exhibited depressed rates for state 3 respiration ( 336 +/- 26 versus 425 +/- 53 natom O/min/mg protein ) and a lower respiratory control ratio ( RCR ) ( 4.3 +/- 0.6 versus 5.8 +/- 0.4 ) compared with cardiac mitochondria isolated from saline-treated rats . 
Mitochondrial C_D002118-loading capacity and the activity of NADH-dehydrogenase were also suppressed in cardiac mitochondria from C_D004317-treated rats . 
C_D004317 treatment also caused a decrease in RCR for liver mitochondria ( 3.9 +/- 0.9 versus 5.6 +/- 0.7 for control rats ) and inhibition of hepatic cytochrome oxidase activity . 
Coadministration of C_C043211 decreased the extent of cellular vacuolization in cardiac myocytes and prevented the inhibitory effect of C_D004317 on mitochondrial respiration in both heart and liver . 
C_C043211 also prevented the decrease in mitochondrial C_D002118 ( 2+ ) loading capacity and the inhibition of the respiratory complexes of heart mitochondria caused by C_D004317 . 
C_C043211 by itself did not affect any of the parameters measured for heart or liver mitochondria . 
It is concluded that this protection by C_C043211 against both the structural and functional cardiac tissue damage may afford significant clinical advantage in minimizing the dose-limiting D_D028361 and D_D009202 that accompanies long-term C_D004317 therapy in D_D009369 patients .

title : C_D003042-induced D_D006948 is more influenced by C_D000241 receptor agonists than C_D000661-induced D_D006948 . 
abstract : The influence of C_D000241 receptor agonists and antagonists on C_D003042-and C_D000661-induced D_D006948 was examined in mice . 
All C_D000241 receptor agonists significantly D_D004409 in mice , and the effects were dose-dependent . 
It seems that C_D000241 A1 and A2 receptors might be involved in this reaction . 
Moreover , all C_D000241 receptor agonists : 2-p- ( 2-carboxyethyl ) phenethylamino-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoC_D000241 ( C_C061282 ) , A2A receptor agonist , N6-cyclopentylC_D000241 ( C_C048599 ) , A1 receptor agonist , and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoC_D000241 ( C_D019830 ) , A2/A1 receptor agonist significantly and dose-dependently decreased C_D003042-induced locomotor activity . 
C_C048599 reduced C_D003042 action at the doses which , given alone , did not influence motility , while C_C061282 and C_D019830 decreased the action of C_D003042 at the doses which , given alone , decreased locomotor activity in animals . 
These results suggest the involvement of both C_D000241 receptors in the action of C_D003042 although agonists of A1 receptors seem to have stronger influence on it . 
The selective blockade of A2 C_D000241 receptor by C_C057837 ( C_C057837 ) significantly enhanced C_D003042-induced locomotor activity of animals . 
C_D002110 had similar action but the effect was not significant . 
C_C053907 ( C_C053907 ) -- A1 receptor antagonist , did not show any influence in this test . 
Similarly , all C_D000241 receptor agonists decreased C_D000661-induced D_D006948 , but at the higher doses than those which were active in C_D003042-induced D_D006948 . 
The selective blockade of A2 C_D000241 receptors ( C_C057837 ) and non-selective blockade of C_D000241 receptors ( C_D002110 ) significantly increased the action of C_D000661 in the locomotor activity test . 
Our results have shown that all C_D000241 receptor agonists ( A1 and A2 ) reduce C_D003042- and C_D000661-induced locomotor activity and indicate that C_D003042-induced D_D006948 is more influenced by C_D000241 receptor agonists ( particularly A1 receptors ) than C_D000661-induced D_D006948 .

title : C_D000638 and the risk of D_D001919 requiring permanent pacemaker in elderly patients with D_D001281 and prior D_D009203 . 
abstract : OBJECTIVES : The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of C_D000638 in patients with D_D001281 ( D_D001281 ) increases the risk of D_D001919 requiring a permanent pacemaker . 
BACKGROUND : Reports of severe D_D001919 during C_D000638 therapy are infrequent and limited to studies assessing the therapy 's use in the management of patients with D_D001145 . 
METHODS : A study cohort of 8,770 patients age > or =65 years with a new diagnosis of D_D001281 was identified from a provincewide database of Quebec residents with a D_D009203 ( D_D009203 ) between 1991 and 1999 . 
Using a nested case-control design , 477 cases of D_D001919 requiring a permanent pacemaker were matched ( 1:4 ) to 1,908 controls . 
Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio ( OR ) of pacemaker insertion associated with C_D000638 use , controlling for baseline risk factors and exposure to C_D013015 , Class I antiarrhythmic agents , beta-blockers , C_D002118 channel blockers , and C_D004077 . 
RESULTS : C_D000638 use was associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion ( OR : 2.14 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.30 to 3.54 ) . 
This effect was modified by gender , with a greater risk in women versus men ( OR : 3.86 , 95 % CI : 1.70 to 8.75 vs. OR : 1.52 , 95 % CI : 0.80 to 2.89 ) . 
C_D004077 was the only other medication associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion ( OR : 1.78 , 95 % CI : 1.37 to 2.31 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : This study suggests that the use of C_D000638 in elderly patients with D_D001281 and a previous D_D009203 increases the risk of D_D001919 requiring a permanent pacemaker . 
The finding of an augmented risk of pacemaker insertion in elderly women receiving C_D000638 requires further investigation .

title : C_D007213-induced morphologic changes in the rat urinary bladder epithelium . 
abstract : OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the morphologic changes in rat urothelium induced by C_D007213 . 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced D_D003556 is a poorly recognized and under-reported condition . 
In addition to C_C021270 , C_D007213 has been reported to be associated with this condition . 
METHODS : Three groups were established : a control group ( n = 10 ) , a high-dose group ( n = 10 ) , treated with one intraperitoneal injection of C_D007213 20 mg/kg , and a therapeutic dose group ( n = 10 ) in which oral C_D007213 was administered 3.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 3 weeks . 
The animals were then killed and the bladders removed for light and electron microscopic studies . 
RESULTS : The light microscopic findings showed some focal epithelial degeneration that was more prominent in the high-dose group . 
When compared with the control group , both C_D007213 groups revealed statistically increased numbers of mast cells in the mucosa ( P < 0.0001 ) and penetration of C_C016534 through intercellular areas of the epithelium . 
Furthermore , the difference in mast cell counts between the high and therapeutic dose groups was also statistically significant ( P < 0.0001 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : C_D007213 resulted in histopathologic findings typical of interstitial D_D003556 , such as leaky bladder epithelium and mucosal D_D008415 . 
The true incidence of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced D_D003556 in humans must be clarified by prospective clinical trials .

title : An open-label phase II study of low-dose C_D013792 in C_D000728-independent D_D011471 . 
abstract : The antiangiogenic effects of C_D013792 have been assessed in clinical trials in patients with various solid and D_D019337 . 
C_D013792 blocks the activity of angiogenic agents including bFGF , VEGF and IL-6 . 
We undertook an open-label study using C_D013792 100 mg once daily for up to 6 months in 20 men with C_D000728-independent D_D011471 . 
The mean time of study was 109 days ( median 107 , range 4-184 days ) . 
Patients underwent regular measurement of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , C_D014508 and electrolytes , serum bFGF and VEGF . 
Three men ( 15 % ) showed a decline in serum PSA of at least 50 % , sustained throughout treatment . 
Of 16 men treated for at least 2 months , six ( 37.5 % ) showed a fall in absolute PSA by a median of 48 % . 
Increasing levels of serum bFGF and VEGF were associated with progressive disease ; five of six men who demonstrated a fall in PSA also showed a decline in bFGF and VEGF levels , and three of four men with a rising PSA showed an increase in both growth factors . 
Adverse effects included D_D003248 , morning D_D006970 , D_D004244 and D_D005076 , and resulted in withdrawal from the study by three men . 
Evidence of D_D010523 was found in nine of 13 men before treatment . 
In the seven men who completed six months on C_D013792 , subclinical evidence of D_D010523 was found in four before treatment , but in all seven at repeat testing . 
The findings indicate that C_D013792 may be an option for patients who have failed other forms of therapy , provided close follow-up is maintained for development of D_D010523 .

title : D_D020258 following the administration of C_C476513 for lumbar plexus block : A report of two cases . 
abstract : BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : Central nervous system and D_D066126 following the administration of local anesthetics is a recognized complication of regional anesthesia . 
C_C476513 , the pure S ( - ) enantiomer of C_D002045 , was developed to improve the cardiac safety profile of C_D002045 . 
We describe 2 cases of D_D004830 following accidental intravascular injection of C_C476513 . 
CASE REPORT : Two patients presenting for elective orthopedic surgery of the lower limb underwent blockade of the lumbar plexus via the posterior approach . 
Immediately after the administration of C_C476513 0.5 % with C_D004837 2.5 microgram/mL , the patients developed D_D004830 , despite negative aspiration for blood and no clinical signs of intravenous C_D004837 administration . 
The D_D012640 were successfully treated with C_D013874 in addition to C_D013390 in 1 patient . 
Neither patient developed signs of D_D002318 . 
Both patients were treated preoperatively with beta-adrenergic antagonist medications , which may have masked the cardiovascular signs of the unintentional intravascular administration of C_C476513 with C_D004837 . 
CONCLUSIONS : Although C_C476513 may have a safer D_D066126 profile than racemic C_D002045 , if adequate amounts of C_C476513 reach the circulation , it will result in D_D012640 . 
Plasma concentrations sufficient to result in D_D020258 did not produce manifestations of D_D066126 in these 2 patients .

title : Anaesthetic complications associated with D_D009224 : case study and comparison with other D_D020967 . 
abstract : D_D009224 ( D_D009224 ) is caused by a defect in the skeletal muscle C_D002712 channel function , which may cause D_-1 . 
We describe a previously healthy 32-year-old woman who developed a life-threatening D_D013035 and secondary ventilation difficulties following a preoperative injection of C_D013390 . 
The D_D013035s disappeared spontaneously and the surgery proceeded without further problems . 
When subsequently questioned , she reported minor symptoms suggesting a D_D020967 . 
D_D009222 was found on clinical examination and EMG . 
The diagnosis D_D009224 was confirmed genetically . 
Neither the patient nor the anaesthetist were aware of the diagnosis before this potentially lethal complication occurred . 
We give a brief overview of D_-1 including D_D008305 and their anaesthetic considerations .

title : Respiratory pattern in a rat model of D_D004827 . 
abstract : PURPOSE : D_D001049 is known to occur during D_D012640 , but systematic studies of ictal respiratory changes in adults are few . 
Data regarding respiratory pattern defects during interictal periods also are scarce . 
Here we sought to generate information with regard to the interictal period in animals with C_D010862-induced D_D004827 . 
METHODS : Twelve rats ( six chronically D_D004827 animals and six controls ) were anesthetized , given tracheotomies , and subjected to D_D006985 or hypoventilation conditions . 
Breathing movements caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tidally through a pneumotachograph . 
This flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer , passed through a polygraph , and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation ( VE ) , tidal volume ( VT ) , inspiratory time ( TI ) , expiratory time ( TE ) , breathing frequency ( f ) , and mean inspiratory flow ( VT/TI ) on a breath-by-breath basis . 
RESULTS : The D_D006985 maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in C_D010862-treated and control rats . 
Although VE had a similar decrease in both groups , in the D_D004827 group , the decrease in VE was due to a significant ( p < 0.05 ) increase in TE peak in relation to that of the control animals . 
The hypoventilation maneuver led to an increase in the arterial Paco2 , followed by an increase in VE . 
In the D_D004827 group , the increase in VE was mediated by a significant ( p < 0.05 ) decrease in TE peak compared with the control group . 
Systemic application of KCN , to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreception activation on ventilation , led to a similar increase in VE for both groups . 
CONCLUSIONS : The data indicate that C_D010862-treated animals have an altered ability to react to ( or compensate for ) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determined . 
We speculate on the possible relation of the current findings on treating different D_D004827-associated conditions .

title : Increased serum soluble Fas in patients with D_D017114 due to C_D000082 D_D062787 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND/AIMS : Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas/Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of D_D017114 . 
The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with D_D017114 . 
METHODOLOGY : Serum levels of sFas ( soluble Fas ) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with D_D017114 and 10 normal control subjects . 
Serum levels of D_D009369 D_D009336 factor-alpha and interferon-gamma were also determined by ELISA . 
RESULTS : Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with D_D017114 ( median , 26.8 U/mL ; range , 6.9-52.7 U/mL ) compared to the normal controls ( median , 8.6 U/mL ; range , 6.5-12.0 U/mL , P < 0.0001 ) . 
Levels were significantly greater in patients with D_D017114 due to C_D000082 D_D062787 ( median , 28.7 U/mL ; range , 12.8-52.7 U/mL , n = 17 ) than those due to non-A to E D_D056486 ( median , 12.5 U/mL ; range , 6.9-46.0 U/mL , n = 7 , P < 0.01 ) . 
There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients . 
A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and C_D001224 aminotransferase ( r = 0.613 , P < 0.01 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with D_D017114 may reflect activation of Fas-mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased D_D009369 D_D009336 factor-alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss .

title : Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation for D_D010300 . 
abstract : High frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) is known to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of advanced D_D010300 . 
AIM : We studied the effect of high frequency STN stimulation in 23 patients . 
METHOD : Twenty-three patients suffering from severe D_D010300 ( Stages III-V on Hoehn and Yahr scale ) and , particularly D_D018476 , D_D009127 , and C_D007980-induced D_D004409 underwent bilateral implantation of electrodes in the STN . 
Preoperative and postoperative assessments of these patients at 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 months follow-up , in `` on '' and `` off '' drug conditions , was carried out using Unified D_D010300 Rating Scale , Hoehn and Yahr staging , England activities of daily living score and video recordings . 
RESULTS : After one year of electrical stimulation of the STN , the patients ' scores for activities of daily living and motor examination scores ( Unified D_D010300 Rating Scale parts II and III ) off medication improved by 62 % and 61 % respectively ( p < 0.0005 ) . 
The subscores for the D_D004409 , D_D009127 , D_D014202 and gait also improved . 
( p < 0.0005 ) . 
The average C_D007980 dose decreased from 813 mg to 359 mg . 
The cognitive functions remained unchanged . 
Two patients developed device-related complications and two patients experienced abnormal weight gain . 
CONCLUSION : Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation is an effective treatment for advanced D_D010300 . 
It reduces the severity of `` off '' phase symptoms , improves the axial symptoms and reduces C_D007980 requirements . 
The reduction in the C_D007980 dose is useful in controlling drug-induced D_D004409 .

title : Ocular motility changes after subtenon C_D016190 chemotherapy for D_D012175 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Focal subtenon C_D016190 injections have recently been used as a presumably D_D064420-free adjunct to systemic chemotherapy for intraocular D_D012175 . 
OBJECTIVE : To report our clinical experience with D_D015835 in patients treated with subtenon C_D016190 chemotherapy . 
METHODS : We noted D_D015835 in 10 consecutive patients with D_D012175 who had received subtenon C_D016190 . 
During ocular manipulation under general anesthesia , we assessed their eyes by forced duction testing , comparing ocular motility after D_D009369 control with ocular motility at diagnosis . 
Eyes subsequently enucleated because of treatment failure ( n = 4 ) were examined histologically . 
RESULTS : Limitation of ocular motility was detected in all 12 eyes of 10 patients treated for intraocular D_D012175 with 1 to 6 injections of subtenon C_D016190 as part of multimodality therapy . 
Histopathological examination revealed many lipophages in the periorbital fat surrounding the optic nerve in 1 eye , indicative of phagocytosis of previously existing fat cells and suggesting prior fat D_D009336 . 
The enucleations were technically difficult and hazardous for globe D_D012421 because of extensive orbital soft tissue adhesions . 
CONCLUSIONS : Subtenon C_D016190 chemotherapy is associated with significant D_D005355 of orbital soft tissues , leading to mechanical restriction of eye movements and making subsequent enucleation difficult . 
Subtenon C_D016190 is not free of D_D064420 , and its use is best restricted to specific indications .

title : C_D004977 and D_D009901 . 
abstract : PURPOSE : To demonstrate the association between C_D004977 and D_D009901 . 
METHOD : Thirteen patients who developed D_D009901 after being treated with C_D004977 for tuberculosis of the lung or lymph node at Siriraj Hospital between 1997 and 2001 were retrospectively reviewed . 
The clinical characteristics and initial and final visual acuity were analyzed to determine visual outcome . 
RESULTS : All patients had D_D009901 between 1 to 6 months ( mean = 2.9 months ) after starting C_D004977 therapy at a dosage ranging from 13 to 20 mg/kg/day ( mean = 17 mg/kg/day ) . 
Seven ( 54 % ) of the 13 patients experienced visual recovery after stopping the drug . 
Of 6 patients with irreversible D_D014786 , 4 patients had D_D003920 , D_D005901 and a history of heavy smoking . 
CONCLUSION : Early recognition of D_D009901 should be considered in patients with C_D004977 therapy . 
A low dose and prompt discontinuation of the drug is recommended particularly in individuals with D_D003920 , D_D005901 or who are heavy smokers .

title : Treatment of compensatory D_D013547 with topical C_D006024 . 
abstract : D_D013547 is facial D_D013547 usually associated with the eating of hot spicy food or even smelling this food . 
Current options of treatment include oral anticholinergic drugs , the topical application of anticholinergics or C_C010845 , and the injection of botulinum toxin . 
Thirteen patients have been treated to date with 1.5 % or 2 % topical C_D006024 . 
All patients had D_D013547 , which interfered with their social activities , after transthroacic endoscopic sympathectomy , and which was associated with compensatory focal D_D006945 . 
After applying topical C_D006024 , the subjective effect was excellent ( no D_D013547 after eating hot spicy food ) in 10 patients ( 77 % ) , and fair ( clearly reduced D_D013547 ) in 3 patients ( 23 % ) . 
All had reported incidents of being very embarrassed whilst eating hot spicy foods . 
Adverse effects included a mildly D_D014987 and a D_D010612 in 2 patients ( 2 % C_D006024 ) , a light D_D006261 in 1 patient ( 1.5 % C_D006024 ) . 
The topical application of a C_D006024 pad appeared to be safe , efficacious , well tolerated , and a convenient method of treatment for moderate to severe symptoms of D_D013547 in post transthoracic endoscopic sympathectomy or sympathicotomy patients , with few side effects .

title : Pharmacological characteristics and side effects of a new galenic formulation of C_D015742 without soyabean oil . 
abstract : We compared the pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics and safety profile of a new galenic formulation of C_D015742 ( AM149 1 % ) , which does not contain soyabean oil , with a standard formulation of C_D015742 ( C_D015742 1 % ) . 
In a randomised , double-blind , cross-over study , 30 healthy volunteers received a single intravenous bolus injection of 2.5 mg.kg-1 C_D015742 . 
Plasma C_D015742 levels were measured for 48 h following drug administration and evaluated according to a three-compartment model . 
The pharmacodynamic parameters assessed included induction and emergence times , respiratory and cardiovascular effects , and D_D010146 on injection . 
Patients were monitored for side effects over 48 h. Owing to a high incidence of D_D013924 , the study was terminated prematurely and only the data of the two parallel treatment groups ( 15 patients in each group ) were analysed . 
Plasma concentrations did not differ significantly between the two formulations . 
Anaesthesia induction and emergence times , respiratory and cardiovascular variables showed no significant differences between the two treatment groups . 
D_D010146 on injection ( 80 vs. 20 % , p < 0.01 ) and D_D013924 ( 93.3 vs. 6.6 % , p < 0.001 ) occurred more frequently with AM149 than with C_D015742 . 
Although both formulations had similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles the new formulation is not suitable for clinical use due to the high incidence of D_D013924 produced .

title : C_C030852-related cardiac events : a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials . 
abstract : Several cases of cardiac adverse reactions related to C_C030852 ( C_C030852 ) have been reported in the literature . 
In order to quantify the incidence of these cardiac events , we performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing C_C030852 with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various D_D009369 . 
Randomized clinical trials comparing C_C030852 with other drugs in the treatment of D_D009369 were searched in Medline , Embase , Evidence-based Medicine Reviews databases and the Cochrane library from 1987 to 2002 . 
Outcomes of interest were severe cardiac events , toxic deaths and cardiac event-related deaths reported in each publication . 
We found 19 trials , involving 2441 patients treated by C_C030852 and 2050 control patients . 
The incidence of cardiac events with C_C030852 was 1.19 % [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ( 0.75 ; 1.67 ) ] . 
There was no difference in the risk of cardiac events between C_C030852 and other drugs [ odds ratio : 0.92 , 95 % CI ( 0.54 ; 1.55 ) ] . 
The risk of C_C030852 cardiac events was similar to C_D014751 ( C_D014751 ) and other D_D066126 drugs [ C_D005472 , C_D018943 , C_C056507 ( C_C056507 ) em leader ] . 
Even if it did not reach statistical significance because of a few number of cases , the risk was lower in trials excluding patients with cardiac history , and seemed to be higher in trials including patients with pre-existing D_D006331 . 
C_C030852-related cardiac events concern about 1 % of treated patients in clinical trials . 
However , the risk associated with C_C030852 seems to be similar to that of other chemotherapeutic agents in the same indications .

title : The natural history of C_D020888 associated D_D014786 in patients electing to continue their medication . 
abstract : PURPOSE : To determine the natural history of D_D014786 in a group of patients known to have C_D020888-associated changes who elected to continue the medication because of good D_D012640 control . 
METHODS : All patients taking C_D020888 alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs for at least 5 years ( range 5-12 years ) were entered into a visual surveillance programme . 
Patients were followed up at 6-monthly intervals for not less than 18 months ( range 18-43 months ) . 
In all , 16 patients with unequivocal defects continued the medication . 
Following already published methodology ( Eye 2002 ; 16 ; 567-571 ) monocular mean radial degrees ( MRDs ) to the I/4e isopter on Goldmann perimetry was calculated for the right eye at the time of discovery of a D_D014786 and again after not less than 18 months follow-up . 
RESULTS : Mean right eye MRD at presentation was 36.98 degrees ( range 22.25-51.0 ) , compared to 38.40 degrees ( range 22.5-49.75 ) after follow-up ; P=0.338 unpaired t-test . 
Only one patient demonstrated a D_D014786 during the study period and discontinued treatment . 
CONCLUSION : Established D_D014786 presumed to be due to C_D020888 therapy did not usually progress in spite of continuing use of the medication . 
These data give support to the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of C_D020888-associated D_D014786 may be an idiosyncratic adverse drug reaction rather than dose-dependent D_D064420 .

title : Induction of rosaceiform D_D003872 during treatment of D_D005148 with C_D016559 ointment . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : C_D016559 ointment is increasingly used for anti-inflammatory treatment of sensitive areas such as the face , and recent observations indicate that the treatment is effective in C_D013256-aggravated D_D012393 and perioral D_D003872 . 
We report on rosaceiform D_D003872 as a complication of treatment with C_D016559 ointment . 
OBSERVATIONS : Six adult patients with D_D005148 were treated with C_D016559 ointment because of the ineffectiveness of standard treatments . 
Within 2 to 3 weeks of initially effective and well-tolerated treatment , 3 patients with a history of D_D012393 and 1 with a history of D_D000152 experienced sudden worsening with pustular rosaceiform lesions . 
Biopsy revealed an abundance of Demodex mites in 2 of these patients . 
In 1 patient with eyelid D_D004485 , rosaceiform periocular D_D003872 gradually appeared after 3 weeks of treatment . 
In 1 patient with atopic D_D003872 , telangiectatic and papular D_D012393 insidiously appeared after 5 months of treatment . 
CONCLUSIONS : Our observations suggest that the spectrum of rosaceiform D_D003872 as a complication of treatment with C_D016559 ointment is heterogeneous . 
A variety of factors , such as vasoactive properties of C_D016559 , proliferation of Demodex due to local immunosuppression , and the occlusive properties of the ointment , may be involved in the observed phenomena . 
Future studies are needed to identify individual risk factors .

title : Structural abnormalities in the brains of human subjects who use C_D008694 . 
abstract : We visualize , for the first time , the profile of D_D001930 associated with chronic C_D008694 ( C_D008694 ) abuse . 
Studies of human subjects who have used C_D008694 chronically have revealed deficits in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and cerebral D_D008659 . 
Using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and new computational brain-mapping techniques , we determined the pattern of structural brain alterations associated with chronic C_D008694 abuse in human subjects and related these deficits to D_D003072 . 
We used high-resolution MRI and surface-based computational image analyses to map regional D_D001930 in 22 human subjects who used C_D008694 and 21 age-matched , healthy controls . 
Cortical maps revealed severe gray-matter deficits in the cingulate , limbic , and paralimbic cortices of C_D008694 abusers ( averaging 11.3 % below control ; p < 0.05 ) . 
On average , C_D008694 abusers had 7.8 % smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects ( p < 0.01 ; left , p = 0.01 ; right , p < 0.05 ) and significant white-matter D_D006984 ( 7.0 % ; p < 0.01 ) . 
Hippocampal deficits were mapped and correlated with memory performance on a word-recall test ( p < 0.05 ) . 
MRI-based maps suggest that chronic C_D008694 abuse causes a selective pattern of cerebral deterioration that contributes to D_D008569 . 
C_D008694 may selectively damage the medial temporal lobe and , consistent with metabolic studies , the cingulate-limbic cortex , inducing neuroadaptation , neuropil reduction , or cell death . 
Prominent white-matter D_D006984 may result from altered myelination and adaptive glial changes , including D_D005911 secondary to D_D009422 . 
These brain substrates may help account for the symptoms of C_D008694 abuse , providing therapeutic targets for drug-induced D_D001930 .

title : Disruption of hepatic lipid homeostasis in mice after C_D000638 treatment is associated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha target gene activation . 
abstract : C_D000638 , an efficacious and widely used antiarrhythmic agent , has been reported to cause D_D056486 in some patients . 
To gain insight into the mechanism of this unwanted effect , mice were administered various doses of C_D000638 and examined for changes in hepatic histology and gene regulation . 
C_D000638 induced D_D006529 , hepatocyte microvesicular lipid accumulation , and a significant decrease in serum C_D014280 and C_D005947 . 
Northern blot analysis of hepatic RNA revealed a dose-dependent increase in the expression of a number of genes critical for C_D005227 oxidation , lipoprotein assembly , and lipid transport . 
Many of these genes are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha ( PPARalpha ) , a ligand-activated nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor . 
The absence of induction of these genes as well as D_D006529 in PPARalpha knockout [ PPARalpha-/- ] mice indicated that the effects of C_D000638 were dependent upon the presence of a functional PPARalpha gene . 
Compared to wild-type mice , treatment of PPARalpha-/- mice with C_D000638 resulted in an increased rate and extent of total body D_D015431 . 
The inability of C_D000638 to directly activate either human or mouse PPARalpha transiently expressed in human HepG2 D_D006528 cells indicates that the effects of C_D000638 on the function of this receptor were indirect . 
Based upon these results , we conclude that C_D000638 disrupts hepatic lipid homeostasis and that the increased expression of PPARalpha target genes is secondary to this toxic effect . 
These results provide important new mechanistic information regarding the D_D056486 effects of C_D000638 and indicate that PPARalpha protects against C_D000638-induced D_D056486 .

title : Safety and compliance with once-daily C_C451780 as initial therapy in the Impact of Medical Subspecialty on Patient Compliance to Treatment ( IMPACT ) study . 
abstract : C_C451780 is a new combination product approved for treatment of primary D_D006937 and mixed D_D050171 . 
This open-labeled , multicenter study evaluated the safety of bedtime C_C451780 when dosed as initial therapy and patient compliance to treatment in various clinical practice settings . 
A total of 4,499 patients with D_D050171 requiring drug intervention was enrolled at 1,081 sites . 
Patients were treated with 1 tablet ( 500 mg of C_D009525 extended-release/20 mg of C_D008148 ) once nightly for 4 weeks and then 2 tablets for 8 weeks . 
Patients also received dietary counseling , educational materials , and reminders to call a toll-free number that provided further education about D_D050171 and C_C451780 . 
Primary end points were study compliance , increases in liver transaminases to > 3 times the upper limit of normal , and clinical D_D009135 . 
Final study status was available for 4,217 patients ( 94 % ) . 
Compliance to C_C451780 was 77 % , with 3,245 patients completing the study . 
Patients in the southeast and those enrolled by endocrinologists had the lowest compliance and highest adverse event rates . 
D_D005483 was the most common adverse event , reported by 18 % of patients and leading to discontinuation by 6 % . 
Incidence of increased C_D001224 aminotransferase and/or C_D000409 aminotransferase > 3 times the upper limit of normal was < 0.3 % . 
An increase of C_D003401 phosphokinase to > 5 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0.24 % of patients , and no cases of drug-induced D_D009135 were observed . 
C_C451780 1,000/40 mg , dosed as initial therapy , was associated with good compliance and safety and had very low incidences of increased liver and muscle enzymes .

abstract : Cardioprotective effect of ethanolic extract of C_D010936 fruits ( 500 mg/kg body wt ) was examined in C_D007545 ( 200 mg/kg body wt ) induced D_D009202 in rats . 
In C_D007545 administered rats , the level of lipid C_D010545 increased significantly in the serum and heart . 
A significant decrease was observed in the activity of the myocardial marker enzymes with a concomitant increase in their activity in serum . 
Histopathological examination was carried out to confirm the myocardial D_D009336 . 
C_D010936 pretreatment was found to ameliorate the effect of C_D007545 on lipid C_D010545 formation and retained the activities of the diagnostic marker enzymes .

title : A case of postoperative D_D001008 due to low dose C_D004329 used with patient-controlled analgesia . 
abstract : A multiparous woman in good psychological health underwent urgent caesarean section in labour . 
Postoperatively , she was given a patient-controlled analgesia device delivering boluses of C_D003932 0.5 mg and C_D004329 0.025 mg. Whilst using the device she gradually became anxious , the feeling worsening after each bolus . 
The diagnosis of C_D004329-induced D_D001008 was not made straight away although on subsequent close questioning the patient gave a very clear history . 
After she had received a total of only 0.9 mg C_D004329 , a syringe containing C_D003932 only was substituted and her unease resolved completely . 
We feel that , although the dramatic extrapyramidal side effects of dopaminergic antiemetics are well known , more subtle manifestations may easily be overlooked .

title : Accurate patient history contributes to differentiating D_D003919 : a case study . 
abstract : This case study highlights the important contribution of nursing in obtaining an accurate health history . 
The case discussed herein initially appeared to be neurogenic D_D003919 ( D_D003919 ) secondary to a D_D001930 . 
The nursing staff , by reviewing the patient 's health history with his family , discovered a history of D_D059606 and long-standing C_D008094 use . 
C_D008094 is implicated in drug-induced nephrogenic D_D003919 , and because the patient had not received C_D008094 since being admitted to the hospital , his treatment changed to focus on nephrogenic D_D003919 . 
By combining information from the patient history , the physical examination , and radiologic and laboratory studies , the critical care team demonstrated that the patient had been self-treating his C_D008094-induced nephrogenic D_D003919 and developed neurogenic D_D003919 secondary to D_D001930 . 
Thus successful treatment required that nephrogenic and neurogenic D_D003919 be treated concomitantly .

title : Factors contributing to C_D012254-induced D_D000740 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND AND AIM : C_D016898 and C_D012254 combination therapy for D_D019698 produces hemolytic D_D000740 . 
This study was conducted to identify the factors contributing to C_D012254-induced D_D000740 . 
METHODS : Eighty-eight patients with D_D019698 who received C_D016898 at a dose of 6 MU administered intramuscularly for 24 weeks in combination with C_D012254 administered orally at a dose of 600 mg or 800 mg participated in the study . 
A hemoglobin concentration of < 10 g/dL was defined as C_D012254-induced D_D000740 . 
RESULTS : C_D012254-induced D_D000740 occurred in 18 ( 20.5 % ) patients during treatment . 
A 2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin concentrations in patients with D_D000740 was observed at week 2 after the start of treatment . 
The hemoglobin concentration in patients with > or =2 g/dL decrease at week 2 was observed to be significantly lower even after week 2 than in patients with < 2 g/dL decrease ( P < 0.01 ) . 
A significant relationship was observed between the rate of reduction of hemoglobin concentrations at week 2 and the severity of D_D000740 ( P < 0.01 ) . 
Such factors as sex ( female ) , age ( > or =60 years old ) , and the C_D012254 dose by body weight ( 12 mg/kg or more ) were significant by univariate analysis . 
CONCLUSIONS : Careful administration is necessary in patients > or =60 years old , in female patients , and in patients receiving a C_D012254 dose of 12 mg/kg or more . 
Patients who experience a fall in hemoglobin concentrations of 2 g/dL or more at week 2 after the start of treatment should be monitored with particular care .

title : Oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage in C_D004317-induced cardiac D_D028361 . 
abstract : The purpose of the present study was to determine if elevated reactive C_D010100 ( ROS ) /C_D009584 species ( RNS ) reported to be present in C_D004317 ( C_D004317 ) -induced D_D066126 actually resulted in cardiomyocyte oxidative/nitrative damage , and to quantitatively determine the time course and subcellular localization of these postulated damage products using an in vivo approach . 
B6C3 mice were treated with a single dose of 20 mg/kg C_D004317 . 
Ultrastructural damage and levels of C_C027576 ( C_C027576 ) -protein adducts and C_C002744 ( C_C002744 ) were analyzed . 
Quantitative ultrastructural damage using computerized image techniques showed cardiomyocyte injury as early as 3 hours , with mitochondria being the most extensively and progressively injured subcellular organelle . 
Analysis of C_C027576 protein adducts by immunogold electron microscopy showed appearance of C_C027576 protein adducts in mitochondria as early as 3 hours , with a peak at 6 hours and subsequent decline at 24 hours . 
C_C002744 levels were significantly increased in all subcellular compartments at 6 hours and subsequently declined at 24 hours . 
Our data showed C_D004317 induced C_C027576-protein adducts in mitochondria at the same time point as when D_D028361 initially appeared . 
These results document for the first time in vivo that D_D028361 precedes nitrative damage . 
The progressive nature of D_D028361 suggests that mitochondria , not other subcellular organelles , are the major site of intracellular injury .

title : C_D013015-induced D_D003329 in a patient with D_D002311 associated with sustained D_D017180 . 
abstract : A 54-year-old man with severe left D_D018754 due to D_D002311 was referred to our hospital for symptomatic incessant sustained D_D017180 ( D_D017180 ) . 
After the administration of C_C076259 , sustained D_D017180 was terminated . 
An alternate class III agent , C_D013015 , was also effective for the prevention of D_D017180 . 
However , one month after switching over C_C076259 to C_D013015 , a short duration of ST elevation was documented in ECG monitoring at almost the same time for three consecutive days . 
ST elevation with chest discomfort disappeared since he began taking long-acting C_D004110 . 
D_D003329 may be induced by the non-selective beta-blocking properties of C_D013015 .

title : Effects of the antidepressant C_D014196 , a C_D012701 2A/2C receptor antagonist , on C_D004298-dependent behaviors in rats . 
abstract : RATIONALE : C_D012701 , via stimulation of C_D012701 2C receptors , exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on C_D004298rgic neurotransmission , whereas activation of C_D012701 2A receptors enhances stimulated DAergic neurotransmission . 
The antidepressant C_D014196 is a C_D012701 2A/2C receptor antagonist . 
OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the effect of C_D014196 treatment on behaviors dependent on the functional status of the nigrostriatal DAergic system . 
METHODS : The effect of pretreatment with C_D014196 on C_D003913- and C_D001058-induced D_D009062 , on D_D002375 induced by C_D006220 and C_D001058 ( 0.05 mg/kg , i.p . 
) , on C_D004874-induced wet dog shake ( WDS ) behavior and C_D005473-induced penile erections was studied in rats . 
We also investigated whether C_D014196 induces D_D002375 in rats . 
RESULTS : C_D014196 at 2.5-20 mg/kg i.p . 
did not induce D_D002375 , and did not antagonize C_D001058 ( 1.5 and 3 mg/kg ) stereotypy and C_D001058 ( 0.05 mg/kg ) -induced D_D002375 . 
However , pretreatment with 5 , 10 and 20 mg/kg i.p . 
C_D014196 enhanced C_D003913 stereotypy , and antagonized C_D006220 D_D002375 , C_D004874-induced WDS behavior and C_D005473-induced penile erections . 
C_D014196 at 30 , 40 and 50 mg/kg i.p . 
induced D_D002375 and antagonized C_D001058 and C_D003913 stereotypies . 
CONCLUSIONS : Our results indicate that C_D014196 at 2.5-20 mg/kg does not block pre- and postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors , while at 30 , 40 and 50 mg/kg it blocks postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors . 
Furthermore , at 5 , 10 and 20 mg/kg , C_D014196 blocks C_D012701 2A and C_D012701 2C receptors . 
We suggest that C_D014196 ( 5 , 10 and 20 mg/kg ) , by blocking the C_D012701 2C receptors , releases the nigrostriatal DAergic neurons from tonic inhibition caused by C_D012701 , and thereby potentiates C_D003913 stereotypy and antagonizes C_D006220 D_D002375 .

title : D_D020447 and D_D004409 in D_D010300 . 
abstract : D_D005767 in D_D010300 ( D_D010300 ) have been known for almost two centuries , but many aspects concerning their pathophysiology have not been completely clarified . 
The aim of this study was to characterize the oropharyngeal dynamics in D_D010300 patients with and without C_D007980-induced D_D004409 . 
Fifteen D_D004409 , 12 nonD_D004409 patients , and a control group were included . 
Patients were asked about D_D003680 and evaluated with the Unified D_D010300 Rating Scale Parts II and III and the Hoehn and Yahr scale . 
Deglutition was assessed using modified C_D001464 swallow with videofluoroscopy . 
NonD_D004409 patients , but not the D_D004409 ones , showed less oropharyngeal swallowing efficiency ( OPSE ) for liquid food than controls ( Dunnett , P = 0.02 ) . 
D_D004409 patients tended to have a greater OPSE than nonD_D004409 ( Dunnett , P = 0.06 ) . 
Patients who were using a higher dose of C_D007980 had a greater OPSE and a trend toward a smaller oral transit time ( Pearson 's correlation , P = 0.01 and 0.08 , respectively ) . 
Neither the report of D_D003680 nor any of the D_D010300 severity parameters correlated to the videofluoroscopic variables . 
In the current study , D_D004409 patients performed better in swallowing function , which could be explained on the basis of a greater C_D007980 dose . 
Our results suggest a role for C_D007980 in the oral phase of deglutition and confirm that D_D003680 is not a good predictor of deglutition alterations in D_D010300 .

title : Inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB activation attenuates D_D009395 induced by C_D005839 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Animals treated with C_D005839 can show residual areas of interstitial D_D005355 in the renal cortex . 
This study investigated the expression of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinases and macrophages in the renal cortex and structural and functional renal changes of rats treated with C_D005839 or C_D005839 + C_C020972 ( C_C020972 ) , an NF-kappaB inhibitor . 
METHODS : 38 female Wistar rats were injected with C_D005839 , 40 mg/kg , twice a day for 9 days , 38 with C_D005839 + C_C020972 , and 28 with 0.15 M C_D012965 solution . 
The animals were killed 5 and 30 days after these injections and the kidneys were removed for histological and immunohistochemical studies . 
The results of the immunohistochemical studies were scored according to the extent of staining . 
The fractional interstitial area was determined by morphometry . 
RESULTS : C_D005839-treated rats presented a transitory increase in plasma C_D003404 levels . 
Increased ED-1 , MAP kinases and NF-kappaB staining were also observed in the renal cortex from all C_D005839-treated rats compared to control ( p < 0.05 ) . 
The animals killed on day 30 also presented D_D005355 in the renal cortex despite the recovery of renal function . 
Treatment with C_C020972 reduced the functional and structural changes induced by C_D005839 . 
CONCLUSIONS : These data show that inhibition of NF-kappaB activation attenuates D_D009395 induced by C_D005839 .

title : C_D005947 metabolism in patients with D_D012559 treated with atypical antipsychotic agents : a frequently sampled intravenous C_D005947 tolerance test and minimal model analysis . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : While the incidence of new-onset D_D003920 may be increasing in patients with D_D012559 treated with certain atypical antipsychotic agents , it remains unclear whether atypical agents are directly affecting C_D005947 metabolism or simply increasing known risk factors for D_D003920 . 
OBJECTIVE : To study the 2 drugs most clearly implicated ( C_D003024 and C_C076029 ) and C_D018967 using a frequently sampled intravenous C_D005947 tolerance test . 
DESIGN : A cross-sectional design in stable , treated patients with D_D012559 evaluated using a frequently sampled intravenous C_D005947 tolerance test and the Bergman minimal model analysis . 
SETTING : Subjects were recruited from an urban community mental health clinic and were studied at a general clinical research center . 
Patients Fifty subjects signed informed consent and 41 underwent the frequently sampled intravenous C_D005947 tolerance test . 
Thirty-six nonobese subjects with D_D012559 or D_D011618 , matched by body mass index and treated with either C_D003024 , C_C076029 , or C_D018967 , were included in the analysis . 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Fasting plasma C_D005947 and fasting serum insulin levels , D_D007333 index , homeostasis model assessment of D_D007333 , and C_D005947 effectiveness . 
RESULTS : The mean +/- SD duration of treatment with the identified atypical antipsychotic agent was 68.3 +/- 28.9 months ( C_D003024 ) , 29.5 +/- 17.5 months ( C_C076029 ) , and 40.9 +/- 33.7 ( C_D018967 ) . 
Fasting serum insulin concentrations differed among groups ( F ( 33 ) = 3.35 ; P = .047 ) ( C_D003024 > C_C076029 > C_D018967 ) with significant differences between C_D003024 and C_D018967 ( t ( 33 ) = 2.32 ; P = .03 ) and C_C076029 and C_D018967 ( t ( 33 ) = 2.15 ; P = .04 ) . 
There was a significant difference in D_D007333 index among groups ( F ( 33 ) = 10.66 ; P < .001 ) ( C_D003024 < C_C076029 < C_D018967 ) , with subjects who received C_D003024 and C_C076029 exhibiting significant D_D007333 compared with subjects who were treated with C_D018967 ( C_D003024 vs C_D018967 , t ( 33 ) = -4.29 ; P < .001 ; C_C076029 vs C_D018967 , t ( 33 ) = -3.62 ; P = .001 [ P < .001 ] ) . 
The homeostasis model assessment of D_D007333 also differed significantly among groups ( F ( 33 ) = 4.92 ; P = .01 ) ( C_D003024 > C_C076029 > C_D018967 ) ( C_D003024 vs C_D018967 , t ( 33 ) = 2.94 ; P = .006 ; C_C076029 vs C_D018967 , t ( 33 ) = 2.42 ; P = .02 ) . 
There was a significant difference among groups in C_D005947 effectiveness ( F ( 30 ) = 4.18 ; P = .02 ) ( C_D003024 < C_C076029 < C_D018967 ) with significant differences between C_D003024 and C_D018967 ( t ( 30 ) = -2.59 ; P = .02 ) and C_C076029 and C_D018967 ( t ( 30 ) = -2.34 , P = .03 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : Both nonobese C_D003024- and C_C076029-treated groups displayed significant D_D007333 and impairment of C_D005947 effectiveness compared with C_D018967-treated subjects . 
Patients taking C_D003024 and C_C076029 must be examined for D_D007333 and its consequences .

abstract : After 180 min of temporary D_D020244 in spontaneously D_D006973 rats , the effect of C_D010656-induced D_D006973 on D_D001930 and blood-brain barrier permeability was determined . 
Blood pressure was manipulated by one of the following schedules during 120 min of reperfusion : Control , normotensive reperfusion ; 90/D_D006973 ( 90/D_D006973 ) , blood pressure was increased by 35 mm Hg during the initial 90 min of reperfusion only ; 15/D_D006973 ( 15/D_D006973 ) , normotensive reperfusion for 30 min followed by 15 min of D_D006973 and 75 min of normotension . 
Part A , for eight rats in each group D_D001930 was evaluated by staining tissue using C_C009591 and D_D004487 was evaluated by microgravimetry . 
Part B , for eight different rats in each group blood-brain barrier permeability was evaluated by measuring the amount and extent of extravasation of C_D005070 dye . 
D_D001930 ( percentage of the D_D002545 ) was less in the 15/D_D006973 group ( 16 +/- 6 , mean +/- SD ) versus the 90/D_D006973 group ( 30 +/- 6 ) , which was in turn less than the control group ( 42 +/- 5 ) . 
Specific gravity was greater in the 15/D_D006973 group ( 1.043 +/- 0.002 ) versus the 90/D_D006973 ( 1.036 +/- 0.003 ) and control ( 1.037 +/- 0.003 ) groups . 
C_D005070 ( mug g-1 of brain tissue ) was greater in the 90/D_D006973 group ( 24.4 +/- 6.0 ) versus the control group ( 12.3 +/- 4.1 ) , which was in turn greater than the 15/D_D006973 group ( 7.3 +/- 3.2 ) . 
This study supports a hypothesis that during reperfusion , a short interval of D_D006973 decreases D_D001930 and D_D004487 ; and that sustained D_D006973 increases the risk of vasogenic D_D004487 .

title : People aged over 75 in D_D001281 on C_D014859 : the rate of major D_D006470 and D_D020521 in more than 500 patient-years of follow-up . 
abstract : OBJECTIVES : To determine the incidence of major D_D006470 and D_D020521 in people aged 76 and older with D_D001281 on adjusted-dose C_D014859 who had been recently been admitted to hospital . 
DESIGN : A retrospective observational cohort study . 
SETTING : A major healthcare network involving four tertiary hospitals . 
PARTICIPANTS : Two hundred thirty-five patients aged 76 and older admitted to a major healthcare network between July 1 , 2001 , and June 30 , 2002 , with D_D001281 on C_D014859 were enrolled . 
MEASUREMENTS : Information regarding major D_D006470 episodes , D_D020521s , and C_D014859 use was obtained from patients , relatives , primary physicians , and medical records . 
RESULTS : Two hundred twenty-eight patients ( 42 % men ) with a mean age of 81.1 ( range 76-94 ) were included in the analysis . 
Total follow-up on C_D014859 was 530 years ( mean 28 months ) . 
There were 53 major D_D006470s , for an annual rate of 10.0 % , including 24 ( 45.3 % ) life-threatening and five ( 9.4 % ) fatal bleeds . 
The annual D_D020521 rate after initiation of C_D014859 was 2.6 % . 
CONCLUSION : The rate of major D_D006470 was high in this old , frail group , but excluding fatalities , resulted in no long-term sequelae , and the D_D020521 rate on C_D014859 was low , demonstrating how effective C_D014859 treatment is .

title : Safety of C_C105934 in patients with adverse D_D003875 to C_D000082 ( C_D000082 ) and C_C012655 associated or not with common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . 
abstract : BACKGROUC_C012655D : C_D000082 ( C_D000082 -- C_D000082 ) and C_C012655 ( C_C012655 ) are widely used analgesic-antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs . 
The rate of adverse D_D004342 reactions to these agents is generally low . 
On the contrary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( C_C012655SAIDs ) are commonly involved in such reactions . 
C_C105934 ( C_C105934 ) is a novel drug , with high selectivity and affinity for COX-2 enzyme . 
OBJECTIVE : We evaluated the tolerability of C_C105934 in a group of patients with documented history of adverse D_D003875 to C_D000082 and C_C012655 associated or not to classic C_C012655SAIDs . 
METHODS : We studied 9 patients with D_D004342 to C_D000082 and C_C012655 with or without associated reactions to classic C_C012655SAIDs . 
The diagnosis of C_D000082 and C_C012655-induced D_D003875 was based in vivo challenge . 
The placebo was blindly administered at the beginning of each challenge . 
After three days , a cumulative dosage of 200 mg of C_C105934 in refracted doses were given . 
After 2-3 days , a single dose of 200 mg was administered . 
All patients were observed for 6 hours after each challenge , and controlled again after 24 hours to exclude delayed reactions . 
The challenge was considered positive if one or more of the following appeared : D_D004890 , rush or D_D014581-D_D000799 . 
RESULTS : C_C012655o reaction was observed with placebo and eight patients ( 88.8 % ) tolerated C_C105934 . 
Only one patient developed a moderate D_D000799 of the lips . 
COC_C012655CLUSIOC_C012655 : Only one D_D004342 reaction to C_C105934 was documented among 9 C_D000082 and C_C012655-highly C_C012655SAIDs intolerant patients . 
Thus , we conclude that C_C105934 is a reasonably safe alternative to be used in subjects who do not tolerate C_D000082 and C_C012655 .

title : Case-control study of regular analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use and D_D007676 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Studies on the association between the long-term use of C_D001241 and other analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) and D_D007676 ( D_D007676 ) have given conflicting results . 
In order to examine this association , a case-control study with incident cases of D_D007676 was carried out . 
METHODS : The cases were all patients entering the local dialysis program because of D_D007676 in the study area between June 1 , 1995 and November 30 , 1997 . 
They were classified according to the underlying disease , which had presumably led them to D_D007676 . 
Controls were patients admitted to the same hospitals from where the cases arose , also matched by age and sex . 
Odds ratios were calculated using a conditional logistic model , including potential confounding factors , both for the whole study population and for the various underlying diseases . 
RESULTS : Five hundred and eighty-three cases and 1190 controls were included in the analysis . 
Long-term use of any analgesic was associated with an overall odds ratio of 1.22 ( 95 % CI , 0.89-1.66 ) . 
For specific groups of drugs , the risks were 1.56 ( 1.05-2.30 ) for C_D001241 , 1.03 ( 0.60-1.76 ) for C_D047069 , 0.80 ( 0.39-1.63 ) for C_D000082 , and 0.94 ( 0.57-1.56 ) for nonC_D001241 NSAIDs . 
The risk of D_D007676 associated with C_D001241 was related to the cumulated dose and duration of use , and it was particularly high among the subset of patients with vascular D_D007674 as underlying disease [ 2.35 ( 1.17-4.72 ) ] . 
CONCLUSION : Our data indicate that long-term use of nonC_D001241 analgesic drugs and NSAIDs is not associated with an increased risk of D_D007676 . 
However , the chronic use of C_D001241 may increase the risk of D_D007676 .

title : Growth-associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic D_D004827 rats treated with C_D003513 . 
abstract : PURPOSE : GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting ( MFS ) in various experimental models of D_D004827 . 
To investigate how GAP43 expression ( GAP43-ir ) correlates with MFS , we assessed the intensity ( densitometry ) and extension ( width ) of GAP43-ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus ( IML ) of rats subject to status D_D004827us induced by C_D010862 ( C_D010862 ) , previously injected or not with C_D003513 ( C_D003513 ) , which has been shown to inhibit MFS . 
METHODS : C_D003513 was injected before the C_D010862 injection in adult Wistar rats . 
The C_D010862 group was injected with the same drugs , except for C_D003513 . 
Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later , and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry . 
RESULTS : Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43-ir in the IML between C_D010862 , C_D003513+C_D010862 , and control groups . 
However , the results of the width of the GAP43-ir band in the IML showed that C_D003513+C_D010862 and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0.03 ) as compared with that in the C_D010862 group . 
CONCLUSIONS : Our current finding that animals in the C_D003513+C_D010862 group have a GAP43-ir band in the IML , similar to that of controls , reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals . 
The change in GAP43-ir present in C_D010862-treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP-43 .

title : C_D009538 antagonizes C_D002110- but not C_D010433-induced anxiogenic effect in mice . 
abstract : RATIONALE : C_D009538 and C_D002110 are widely consumed licit psychoactive drugs worldwide . 
Epidemiological studies showed that they were generally used concurrently . 
Although some studies in experimental animals indicate clear pharmacological interactions between them , no studies have shown a specific interaction on D_D001008 responses . 
OBJECTIVES : The present study investigates the effects of C_D009538 on D_D001008 induced by C_D002110 and another anxiogenic drug , C_D010433 , in mice . 
The elevated plus-maze ( EPM ) test was used to evaluate the effects of drugs on D_D001008 . 
METHODS : Adult male Swiss Webster mice ( 25-32 g ) were given C_D009538 ( 0.05-0.25 mg/kg s.c. ) or saline 10 min before C_D002110 ( 70 mg/kg i.p . ) 
or C_D010433 ( 15 and 30 mg/kg i.p . ) 
injections . 
After 15 min , mice were evaluated for their open- and closed-arm time and entries on the EPM for a 10-min session . 
Locomotor activity was recorded for individual groups by using the same treatment protocol with the EPM test . 
RESULTS : C_D009538 ( 0.05-0.25 mg/kg ) itself did not produce any significant effect in the EPM test , whereas C_D002110 ( 70 mg/kg ) and C_D010433 ( 30 mg/kg ) produced an anxiogenic effect , apparent with decreases in open-arm time and entry . 
C_D009538 ( 0.25 mg/kg ) pretreatment blocked the C_D002110- but not C_D010433-induced D_D001008 . 
Administration of each drug and their combinations did not produce any effect on locomotor activity . 
CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that the antagonistic effect of C_D009538 on C_D002110-induced D_D001008 is specific to C_D002110 , instead of a non-specific anxiolytic effect . 
Thus , it may extend the current findings on the interaction between C_D009538 and C_D002110 .

title : Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling D_D008594 . 
It has also been used for the management and prevention of D_D002318 , D_D010024 and D_D003704 in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational . 
OBJECTIVES : To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality , D_D006331 , D_D054556 , D_D020521 , D_D002546 , D_D001943 , D_D015179 , D_D010051 , D_D016889 , D_D005705 , cognitive function , D_D003704 , D_D050723 and quality of life . 
SEARCH STRATEGY : We searched the following databases up to November 2004 : the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Biological Abstracts . 
Relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched . 
SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double-blind trials of HT ( C_D004967 with or without C_D011374 ) versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women . 
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Fifteen RCTs were included . 
Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently . 
They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes . 
Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis for most outcomes . 
MAIN RESULTS : All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials . 
In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of D_D054556 or coronary event ( after one year 's use ) , D_D020521 ( after 3 years ) , D_D001943 ( after 5 years ) and D_D005705 . 
Long-term C_D004967-only HT also significantly increased the risk of D_D020521 and D_D005705 . 
Overall , the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of D_D050723 and D_D003110 with long-term use . 
Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of D_D003704 . 
Among women with D_D002318 , long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of D_D054556 . 
No trials focussed specifically on younger women . 
However , one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year-old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking C_D004967-only HT , versus similar-sized placebo groups . 
The only significantly increased risk reported was for D_D054556 in women taking combined continuous HT ; their absolute risk remained very low . 
AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of D_D002908 . 
We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women .

title : D_D056486 : an analysis of 461 incidences submitted to the Spanish registry over a 10-year period . 
abstract : BACKGROUND & AIMS : Progress in the understanding of susceptibility factors to D_D056486 ( D_D056486 ) and outcome predictability are hampered by the lack of systematic programs to detect bona fide cases . 
METHODS : A cooperative network was created in 1994 in Spain to identify all suspicions of D_D056486 following a prospective structured report form . 
The D_D056486 was characterized according to hepatocellular , D_D002779 , and mixed laboratory criteria and to histologic criteria when available . 
Further evaluation of causality assessment was centrally performed . 
RESULTS : Since April 1994 to August 2004 , 461 out of 570 submitted cases , involving 505 drugs , were deemed to be related to D_D056486 . 
The antiinfective group of drugs was the more frequently incriminated , C_D019980 accounting for the 12.8 % of the whole series . 
The hepatocellular pattern of damage was the most common ( 58 % ) , was inversely correlated with age ( P < .0001 ) , and had the worst outcome ( Cox regression , P < .034 ) . 
Indeed , the incidence of liver transplantation and death in this group was 11.7 % if patients had D_D007565 at presentation , whereas the corresponding figure was 3.8 % in nonD_D007565d patients ( P < .04 ) . 
Factors associated with the development of D_D017114 were female sex ( OR = 25 ; 95 % CI : 4.1-151 ; P < .0001 ) , hepatocellular damage ( OR = 7.9 ; 95 % CI : 1.6-37 ; P < .009 ) , and higher baseline plasma C_D001663 value ( OR = 1.15 ; 95 % CI : 1.09-1.22 ; P < .0001 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : Patients with drug-induced hepatocellular D_D007565 have 11.7 % chance of progressing to death or transplantation . 
C_D019980 stands out as the most common drug related to D_D056486 .

title : In vivo evidences suggesting the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of C_D014640-induced D_D007674 : protection by C_C048498 . 
abstract : The aims of this study were to examine C_D014640 ( C_D014640 ) -induced oxidative stress that promotes production of reactive C_D010100 species ( ROS ) and to investigate the role of C_C048498 , an expectorant agent , which has also antioxidant properties , on kidney tissue against the possible C_D014640-induced D_D007674 in rats . 
Rats were divided into three groups : sham , C_D014640 and C_D014640 plus C_C048498 . 
C_D014640 was administrated intraperitoneally ( i.p . ) 
with 200mgkg ( -1 ) twice daily for 7 days . 
C_C048498 was administered orally . 
C_D014640 administration to control rats significantly increased renal C_D008315 ( C_D008315 ) and urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase ( NAG , a marker of D_D007674 ) excretion but decreased C_D013481 dismutase ( SOD ) and catalase ( CAT ) activities . 
C_C048498 administration with C_D014640 injections caused significantly decreased renal C_D008315 and urinary NAG excretion , and increased SOD activity , but not CAT activity in renal tissue when compared with C_D014640 alone . 
C_C048498 showed histopathological protection against C_D014640-induced D_D007674 . 
There were a significant dilatation of tubular lumens , extensive epithelial cell vacuolization , D_D001284 , D_-1 , and D_D009336 in C_D014640-treated rats more than those of the control and the C_C048498 groups . 
C_C048498 caused a marked reduction in the extent of tubular damage . 
It is concluded that oxidative tubular damage plays an important role in the C_D014640-induced D_D007674 and the modulation of oxidative stress with C_C048498 reduces the C_D014640-induced D_D007674 both at the biochemical and histological levels .

title : Does C_D004294 potentiate C_C035133-associated D_D012148 ? 
abstract : There is now evidence to suggest a central role for the C_D004298rgic system in D_D012148 ( D_D012148 ) . 
For example , the symptoms of D_D012148 can be dramatically improved by C_D007980 and C_D004298 agonists , whereas central C_D004298 D2 receptor antagonists can induce or aggravate D_D012148 symptoms . 
To our knowledge , there is no previous report regarding whether C_D004294 , a peripheral C_D004298 D2 receptor antagonist , can also induce or aggravate symptoms of D_D012148 . 
C_C035133 , the first noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant ( NaSSA ) , has been associated with D_D012148 in several recent publications . 
The authors report here a depressed patient comorbid with D_D004415 who developed D_D012148 after C_C035133 had been added to his C_D004294 therapy . 
Our patient started to have symptoms of D_D012148 only after he had been treated with C_C035133 , and his D_D012148 symptoms resolved completely upon discontinuation of his C_C035133 . 
Such a temporal relationship between the use of C_C035133 and the symptoms of D_D012148 in our patient did not support a potentiating effect of C_D004294 on C_C035133-associated D_D012148 . 
However , physicians should be aware of the possibility that C_C035133 can be associated with D_D012148 in some individuals , especially those receiving concomitant C_D004298 D2 receptor antagonists .

title : Antiandrogenic therapy can cause D_D003324 . 
abstract : AIM : To study the change of lipid metabolism by antiandrogen therapy in patients with D_D011471 . 
MATERIALS AND METHODS : We studied with a 2.5 years follow-up the changes in plasma C_D002784_D002784 ( C_D002784 ) , C_D014280 ( C_D014280 ) , lipoproteins ( LP ) , and apolipoproteins ( Apo ) B-100 , A-I , and A-II pro fi les in 24 patients of mean age 60 years with low risk D_D011471 ( stage : T1cN0M0 , Gleason score : 2-5 ) during treatment with C_D017373 ( C_D002784PA ) without surgical management or radiation therapy . 
RESULTS : Significant decreases of HDL-C_D002784 , Apo A-I and Apo A-II and an increase of C_D014280 levels in VLDL were induced by C_D002784PA . 
After a period of 2.5 years on C_D002784PA treatment , four patients out of twenty-four were found to be affected by D_D003327 .

title : C_D005472 D_D066126 induced by C_C032348 . 
abstract : D_D066126 is a rare complication occurring during C_D005472 ( C_D005472 ) treatment for D_D009369 . 
We herein report the case of a 70-year-old man with C_D005472-induced D_D066126 , in whom a high serum level of C_C032348 ( C_C032348 ) was observed . 
The patient , who had unresectable D_D003110 metastases to the liver and lung , was referred to us for chemotherapy from an affiliated hospital ; he had no cardiac history . 
After admission , the patient received a continuous intravenous infusion of C_D005472 ( 1000 mg/day ) , during which D_D002637 with D_D002037 occurred concomitantly with a high serum C_C032348 concentration of 1955 ng/ml . 
Both the D_D002637 and the electrocardiographic changes disappeared spontaneously after the discontinuation of C_D005472 . 
As the D_D002637 in this patient was considered to have been due to C_D005472-induced D_D066126 , the administration of C_D005472 was abandoned . 
Instead , oral administration of S-1 ( a derivative of C_D005472 ) , at 200 mg/day twice a week , was instituted , because S-1 has a strong inhibitory effect on C_C020047 dehydrogenase , which catalyzes the degradative of C_D005472 into C_C032348 . 
The serum C_C032348 concentration subsequently decreased to 352 ng/ml , the same as the value measured on the first day of S-1 administration . 
Thereafter , no D_D009461 were observed . 
The patient achieved a partial response 6 months after the initiation of the S-1 treatment . 
The experience of this case , together with a review of the literature , suggests that C_C032348 is related to C_D005472-induced D_D066126 . 
S-1 may be administered safely to patients with C_D005472-induced D_D066126 .

title : The influence of the time interval between C_C522803 and C_D004317 administration on the protection against C_D004317-induced D_D066126 in mice . 
abstract : PURPOSE : Despite its well-known D_D066126 , the anthracyclin C_D004317 ( C_D004317 ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent . 
C_D004317-induced D_D006331 presumably results from the formation of free radicals by C_D004317 . 
Reactive C_D010100 species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system . 
The semisynthetic C_D005419 C_C522803 ( C_C522803 ) showed cardioprotection against C_D004317-induced D_D066126 through its radical scavenging and C_D007501 chelating properties . 
Because of the relatively short final half-life of C_C522803 ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between C_C522803 and C_D004317 might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of C_C522803 . 
Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect . 
METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB/c mice were treated with saline , C_D004317 alone or C_D004317 ( 4 mg/kg i.v . ) 
preceded by C_C522803 ( 500 mg/kg i.p . ) 
with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min . 
After a 6-week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed . 
Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which D_D009202 was evaluated according to Billingham ( in D_D009369 Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) :865-872 , 1978 ) . 
Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with C_D004317 alone induced significant D_D006331 in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0.001 ) . 
RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9.6-fold ( 95 % CI 4.4-21.0 ) higher in mice treated with C_D004317 alone than that in animals of the control group . 
The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with C_D004317 preceded by C_C522803 and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 ( mean 2.2 , 95 % CI 1.2-4.1 , P=0.019 ) . 
The mean protective effect by adding C_C522803 before C_D004317 led to a significant 4.4-fold reduction ( P < 0.001 , 95 % CI 2.3-8.2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes . 
This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between C_C522803 and C_D004317 administration ( P=0.345 ) . 
CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting C_C522803 may be administered shortly before C_D004317 .

title : Clinical evaluation of adverse effects during C_D015764 administration for D_D001281 and flutter . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : C_D015764 ( C_D015764 ) has attracted attention as an effective drug for D_D001281 ( D_D001281 ) and D_D001282 ( D_D001281L ) . 
However , serious adverse effects , including D_D016171 ( D_D016171 ) , have been reported . 
METHODS AND RESULTS : Adverse effects of C_D015764 requiring discontinuation of treatment were evaluated . 
C_D015764 was administered to 459 patients ( 361 males , 63+/-12 years old ) comprising 378 D_D001281 and 81 D_D001281L cases . 
Mean left ventricular ejection fraction and atrial dimension ( LAD ) were 66+/-11 % and 40+/-6 mm , respectively . 
Adverse effects were observed in 19 patients ( 4 % ) during an average follow-up of 20 months . 
There was marked D_D008133 greater than 0.55 s in 13 patients , D_D001919 less than 40 beats/min in 6 patients , D_D004244 and general D_D005221 in 1 patient each . 
In 4 of 13 patients with D_D008133 , D_D016171 occurred . 
The major triggering factors of D_D016171 were D_D007008 and sudden decrease in heart rate . 
There were no differences in the clinical backgrounds of the patients with and without D_D016171 other than LAD and age , which were larger and older in the patients with D_D016171 . 
CONCLUSION : Careful observation of serum C_D011188 concentration and the ECG should always be done during C_D015764 administration , particularly in elderly patients .

title : Enhanced C_D007545-induced D_D006332 in transgenic rats with low brain C_D000804ogen . 
abstract : We have previously shown that a permanent deficiency in the brain renin-C_D000804 system ( RAS ) may increase the sensitivity of the baroreflex control of heart rate . 
In this study we aimed at studying the involvement of the brain RAS in the cardiac reactivity to the beta-adrenoceptor ( beta-AR ) agonist C_D007545 ( C_D007545 ) . 
Transgenic rats with low brain C_D000804ogen ( TGR ) were used . 
In isolated hearts , C_D007545 induced a significantly greater increase in left ventricular ( LV ) pressure and maximal contraction ( +dP/dt ( max ) ) in the TGR than in the Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rats . 
D_D006332 induced by C_D007545 treatment was significantly higher in TGR than in SD rats ( in g LV wt/100 g body wt , 0.28 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.004 , respectively ) . 
The greater D_D006332 in TGR rats was associated with more pronounced downregulation of beta-AR and upregulation of LV beta-AR kinase-1 mRNA levels compared with those in SD rats . 
The decrease in the heart rate ( HR ) induced by the beta-AR antagonist C_D008790 in conscious rats was significantly attenuated in TGR compared with SD rats ( -9.9 +/- 1.7 % vs. -18.1 +/- 1.5 % ) , whereas the effect of parasympathetic blockade by C_D001285 on HR was similar in both strains . 
These results indicate that TGR are more sensitive to beta-AR agonist-induced D_D006331 response and D_D006984 , possibly due to chronically low sympathetic outflow directed to the heart .

title : Drug-induced D_D008133 in injection drug users receiving C_D008691 : high frequency in hospitalized patients and risk factors . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Drug-induced D_D008133 is a serious adverse drug reaction . 
C_D008691 prolongs the QT interval in vitro in a dose-dependent manner . 
In the inpatient setting , the frequency of D_D008133 with C_D008691 treatment , its dose dependence , and the importance of cofactors such as drug-drug interactions remain unknown . 
METHODS : We performed a systematic , retrospective study comparing active or former intravenous drug users receiving C_D008691 and those not receiving C_D008691 among all patients hospitalized over a 5-year period in a tertiary care hospital . 
A total of 167 patients receiving C_D008691 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were compared with a control group of 80 injection drug users not receiving C_D008691 . 
In addition to C_D008691 dose , 15 demographic , biological , and pharmacological variables were considered as potential risk factors for D_D008133 . 
RESULTS : Among 167 C_D008691 maintenance patients , the prevalence of QTc prolongation to 0.50 second ( ( 1/2 ) ) or longer was 16.2 % compared with 0 % in 80 control subjects . 
Six patients ( 3.6 % ) in the C_D008691 group presented D_D016171 . 
QTc length was weakly but significantly associated with C_D008691 daily dose ( Spearman rank correlation coefficient , 0.20 ; P < .01 ) . 
Multivariate regression analysis allowed attribution of 31.8 % of QTc variability to C_D008691 dose , cytochrome P-450 3A4 drug-drug interactions , D_D007008 , and altered liver function . 
CONCLUSIONS : D_D008133 in C_D008691 maintenance patients hospitalized in a tertiary care center is a frequent finding . 
C_D008691 dose , presence of cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors , C_D011188 level , and liver function contribute to D_D008133 . 
D_D008133 can occur with low doses of C_D008691 .

title : Mechanisms of D_D006973 induced by C_D009569 ( C_D009569 ) deficiency : focus on venous function . 
abstract : Loss of endothelial cell-derived C_D009569 ( C_D009569 ) in D_D006973 is a hallmark of D_D018754 . 
Experimental D_D006973 created by the removal of C_D009569 , however , involves mechanisms in addition to decreased arterial vasodilator activity . 
These include augmented endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) release , increased sympathetic nervous system activity , and elevated tissue oxidative stress . 
We hypothesized that increased venous smooth muscle ( venomotor ) tone plays a role in C_D019335 ( C_D019335 ) D_D006973 through these mechanisms . 
Rats were treated with the C_D009569 synthase inhibitor C_D019335 ( 0.5 g/L in drinking water ) for 2 weeks . 
Mean arterial pressure of conscious rats was 119 +/- 2 mm Hg in control and 194 +/- 5 mm Hg in C_D019335 rats ( P < 0.05 ) . 
Carotid arteries and vena cava were removed for measurement of isometric contraction . 
Maximal contraction to C_D009638 was modestly reduced in arteries from C_D019335 compared with control rats whereas the maximum contraction to ET-1 was significantly reduced ( 54 % control ) . 
Maximum contraction of vena cava to C_D009638 ( 37 % control ) also was reduced but no change in response to ET-1 was observed . 
Mean circulatory filling pressure , an in vivo measure of venomotor tone , was not elevated in C_D019335 D_D006973 at 1 or 2 weeks after C_D019335 . 
The C_D013481 scavenger C_C001803 ( 30 , 100 , and 300 micromol kg ( -1 ) , IV ) did not change arterial pressure in control rats but caused a dose-dependent decrease in C_D019335 rats ( -18 +/- 8 , -26 +/- 15 , and -54 +/- 11 mm Hg ) . 
Similarly , ganglionic blockade with C_D018738 caused a significantly greater fall in C_D019335 D_D006973 rats ( 76 +/- 9 mm Hg ) compared with control rats ( 35 +/- 10 mm Hg ) . 
Carotid arteries , vena cava , and sympathetic ganglia from C_D019335 rats had higher basal levels of C_D013481 compared with those from control rats . 
These data suggest that while C_D009569 deficiency increases oxidative stress and sympathetic activity in both arterial and venous vessels , the impact on veins does not make a major contribution to this form of D_D006973 .

title : Association of DRD2 polymorphisms and C_D002746-induced D_D001480 in Chinese D_D012559 patients . 
abstract : AIM : D_D001480 ( D_D001480 ) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the D2 receptor . 
Recently , many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the DRD2 gene and the therapeutic response in D_D012559 patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression . 
In this study , we evaluate the role DRD2 plays in C_D002746-induced D_D001480 in D_D012559 patients . 
METHODS : We identified seven SNP ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) ( -141Cins > del , TaqIB , TaqID , Ser311Cys , rs6275 , rs6277 and TaqIA ) in the DRD2 gene in 146 D_D012559 inpatients ( 59 with D_D001480 and 87 without D_D001480 according to the Simpson-Angus Scale ) treated with C_D002746 after 8 weeks . 
The alleles of all loci were determined by PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) . 
RESULTS : Polymorphisms TaqID , Ser311Cys and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study . 
No statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -141Cins > del , TaqIB , rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes ( constituted by TaqIB , rs6275 and TaqIA ) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups . 
CONCLUSION : Our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the DRD2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by C_D002746 , at least in Chinese patients with D_D012559 . 
Our results confirmed a previous study on the relationship between DRD2 and D_D001480 in Caucasians .

title : Physical training decreases susceptibility to subsequent C_D010862-induced D_D012640 in the rat . 
abstract : Regular motor activity has many benefits for mental and physical condition but its implications for D_D004827 are still controversial . 
In order to elucidate this problem , we have studied the effect of long-term physical activity on susceptibility to subsequent D_D012640 . 
Male Wistar rats were subjected to repeated training sessions in a treadmill and swimming pool . 
Thereafter , D_D012640 were induced by C_D010862 injections in trained and non-trained control groups . 
During the acute period of D_D013226 , we measured : ( 1 ) the latency of the first motor sign , ( 2 ) the intensity of D_D012640 , ( 3 ) the time when it occurred within the 6-h observation period , and ( 4 ) the time when the acute period ended . 
All these behavioral parameters showed statistically significant changes suggesting that regular physical exercises decrease susceptibility to subsequently induced D_D012640 and ameliorate the course of experimentally induced D_D013226 .

title : Tonic C_D004298rgic stimulation D_D007859 in healthy subjects . 
abstract : Endogenous C_D004298 plays a central role in salience coding during associative learning . 
Administration of the C_D004298 precursor C_D007980 enhances learning in healthy subjects and D_D020521 patients . 
Because C_D007980 increases both phasic and tonic C_D004298rgic neurotransmission , the critical mechanism mediating the enhancement of learning is unresolved . 
We here probed how selective tonic C_D004298rgic stimulation affects associative learning . 
Forty healthy subjects were trained in a novel vocabulary of 45 concrete nouns over the course of 5 consecutive training days in a prospective , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled design . 
Subjects received the tonically stimulating C_D004298-receptor agonist C_D010479 ( 0.1 mg ) vs placebo 120 min before training on each training day . 
The C_D004298 agonist significantly D_D007859 compared to placebo . 
This learning decrement persisted up to the last follow-up 4 weeks post-training . 
Subjects treated with C_D010479 also showed restricted emotional responses compared to the PLACEBO group . 
The extent of 'flattened ' affect with C_D010479 was related to the degree of learning inhibition . 
These findings suggest that tonic occupation of C_D004298 receptors impairs learning by competition with phasic C_D004298 signals . 
Thus , phasic signaling seems to be the critical mechanism by which C_D004298 enhances associative learning in healthy subjects and D_D020521 patients .

title : C_D008911-induced D_D014657 fulfilling the criteria of D_D010488 . 
abstract : A 47-year-old man who had been taking C_D008911 for D_D011565 developed D_D005334 , D_D063806 , D_D011115 , and D_D013733 , with elevated C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . 
Neither myeloperoxidase- nor proteinase-3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody was positive . 
These manifestations met the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of D_D010488 . 
Stopping C_D008911 led to amelioration of symptoms and normalization of CRP level . 
To our knowledge , this is the second case of C_D008911-induced D_D014657 satisfying the criteria . 
Differential diagnosis for drug-induced disease is invaluable even for patients with classical D_D010488 .

title : Intramuscular D_D006509 immune globulin combined with C_D019259 in prevention of D_D006509 recurrence after liver transplantation . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Combined D_D006509 immune globulin ( HBIg ) and C_D019259 in prophylaxis of the recurrence of D_D006509 after liver transplantation has significantly improved the survival of C_D006514 positive patients . 
This study was undertaken to evaluate the outcomes of liver transplantation for patients with D_D006509 virus ( HBV ) . 
METHODS : A retrospective chart analysis and a review of the organ transplant database identified 51 patients ( 43 men and 8 women ) transplanted for benign HBV-related D_D008103 between June 2002 and December 2004 who had survived more than 3 months . 
HBIg was administered intravenously during the first week and intramuscularly thereafter . 
RESULTS : At a median follow-up of 14.1 months , the overall recurrence rate in the 51 patients was 3.9 % ( 2/51 ) . 
The overall patient survival was 88.3 % , and 82.4 % after 1 and 2 years , respectively . 
A daily oral dose of 100 mg C_D019259 for 2 weeks before transplantation for 10 patients enabled 57.1 % ( 4/7 ) and 62.5 % ( 5/8 ) of HBV-DNA and C_D006513 positive patients respectively to convert to be negative . 
Intramuscular HBIg was well tolerated in all patients . 
CONCLUSION : C_D019259 combined with intramuscular HBIg can effectively prevent allograft from the recurrence of HBV after liver transplantation .

title : Anticonvulsant effect of C_C416835 ( C_C416835 ) on D_D012640 induced by microperfusion of C_D010852 in the hippocampus of freely moving rats . 
abstract : C_C416835 ( C_C416835 , C_C416835 ) is a novel antiepileptic drug , now in Phase III clinical trials , designed with the aim of improving efficacy and safety in comparison with the structurally related drugs C_D002220 ( C_D002220 ) and C_C036006 ( C_C036006 ) . 
We have studied the effects of oral treatment with C_C416835 on a whole-animal model in which partial D_D012640 can be elicited repeatedly on different days without changes in threshold or D_D012640 patterns . 
In the animals treated with threshold doses of C_D010852 , the average number of D_D012640 was 2.3+/-1.2 , and average D_D012640 duration was 39.5+/-8.4s . 
Pre-treatment with a dose of 30 mg/kg 2h before C_D010852 microperfusion prevented D_D012640 in the 75 % of the rats . 
Lower doses ( 3 and 10mg/kg ) did not suppress D_D012640 , however , after administration of 10mg/kg , significant reductions in D_D012640 duration ( 24.3+/-6.8s ) and D_D012640 number ( 1.6+/-0.34 ) were found . 
No adverse effects of C_C416835 were observed in the behavioral/EEG patterns studied , including sleep/wakefulness cycle , at the doses studied .

title : D_D058186 associated with prolonged intake of slimming pills containing C_D000880 . 
abstract : C_D004365 medicine preparations are widely available and often regarded by the public as natural and safe remedies for a variety of medical conditions . 
D_D007674 caused by C_D004365 has previously been reported , usually involving the use of C_D034341 . 
We report a 23-year-old woman who developed D_D058186 following prolonged use of a proprietary C_D004365 slimming pill that contained C_D000880 derivatives , extracted from Rhizoma Rhei ( rhubarb ) . 
The D_D058186 was probably aggravated by the concomitant intake of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , C_D004008 . 
Renal pathology was that of hypocellular interstitial D_D005355 . 
Spontaneous renal recovery occurred upon cessation of the slimming pills , but mild interstitial D_D005355 and tubular D_D001284 was still evident histologically 4 months later . 
Although a causal relationship between the use of an C_D000880-containing herbal agent and D_D058186 remains to be proven , phytotherapy-associated interstitial D_D007674 should be considered in patients who present with unexplained D_D051437 .

title : C_C004656 as a C_-1 reagent : the role of critical C_D013438 groups in C_D007069 D_D007674 . 
abstract : C_C004656 ( C_C004656 ) is a metabolite of the alkylating agent C_D007069 ( C_D007069 ) and putatively responsible for D_D007674 following anti-D_D009369 therapy with C_D007069 . 
Depletion of C_-1 ( C_-1 ) groups has been reported from cell culture , animal and clinical studies . 
In this work the effect of C_C004656 on human proximal tubule cells in primary culture ( hRPTEC ) was investigated . 
D_D064420 of C_C004656 was determined by protein content , cell number , LDH release , C_D014343 exclusion assay and caspase-3 activity . 
Free C_D013438s were measured by the method of Ellman . 
C_C004656 reduced hRPTEC cell number and protein , induced a loss in free intracellular C_D013438s and an increase in D_D009336 markers . 
C_C004656 but not C_D000171 inhibited the C_D003545 proteases caspase-3 , caspase-8 and cathepsin B. Caspase activation by C_D002945 was inhibited by C_C004656 . 
In cells stained with fluorescent dyes targeting lysosomes , C_C004656 induced an increase in lysosomal size and lysosomal leakage . 
The effects of C_C004656 on C_D003545 protease activities and C_D013438s could be reproduced in cell lysate . 
Acidification , which slowed the reaction of C_C004656 with C_D013438 donors , could also attenuate effects of C_C004656 on D_D009336 markers , C_D013438 depletion and C_D003545 protease inhibition in living cells . 
Thus , C_C004656 directly reacts with cellular protein and non-protein C_D013438s , mediating its D_D064420 on hRPTEC . 
This effect can be reduced by acidification . 
Therefore , urinary acidification could be an option to prevent C_D007069 D_D007674 in patients .

title : Stereological methods reveal the robust size and stability of ectopic hilar granule cells after C_D010862-induced D_D013226 in the adult rat . 
abstract : Following D_D013226 in the rat , dentate granule cell neurogenesis increases greatly , and many of the new neurons appear to develop ectopically , in the hilar region of the hippocampal formation . 
It has been suggested that the ectopic hilar granule cells could contribute to the spontaneous D_D012640 that ultimately develop after D_D013226 . 
However , the population has never been quantified , so it is unclear whether it is substantial enough to have a strong influence on epileptogenesis . 
To quantify this population , the total number of ectopic hilar granule cells was estimated using unbiased stereology at different times after C_D010862-induced D_D013226 . 
The number of hilar neurons immunoreactive for Prox-1 , a granule-cell-specific marker , was estimated using the optical fractionator method . 
The results indicate that the size of the hilar ectopic granule cell population after D_D013226 is substantial , and stable over time . 
Interestingly , the size of the population appears to be correlated with the frequency of behavioral D_D012640 , because animals with more ectopic granule cells in the hilus have more frequent behavioral D_D012640 . 
The hilar ectopic granule cell population does not appear to vary systematically across the septotemporal axis , although it is associated with an increase in volume of the hilus . 
The results provide new insight into the potential role of ectopic hilar granule cells in the C_D010862 model of D_D004833 .

title : A prospective , open-label trial of C_D005702 in D_D001321 . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : Post-mortem studies have reported abnormalities of the cholinergic system in D_D001321 . 
The purpose of this study was to assess the use of C_D005702 , an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and nicotinic receptor modulator , in the treatment of interfering behaviors in children with D_D001321 . 
METHODS : Thirteen medication-free children with D_D001321 ( mean age , 8.8 +/- 3.5 years ) participated in a 12-week , open-label trial of C_D005702 . 
Patients were rated monthly by parents on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) and the Conners ' Parent Rating Scale-Revised , and by a physician using the Children 's Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions scale . 
RESULTS : Patients showed a significant reduction in parent-rated D_D001523 and social withdrawal on the ABC as well as significant improvements in emotional lability and D_D019958 on the Conners ' Parent Rating Scale -- Revised . 
Similarly , clinician ratings showed reductions in the anger subscale of the Children 's Psychiatric Rating Scale . 
Eight of 13 participants were rated as responders on the basis of their improvement scores on the Clinical Global Impressions scale . 
Overall , C_D005702 was well-tolerated , with no significant adverse effects apart from D_D006261 in one patient . 
CONCLUSION : In this open trial , C_D005702 was well-tolerated and appeared to be beneficial for the treatment of interfering behaviors in children with D_D001321 , particularly D_D001523 , D_D002653 , and D_D019958 . 
Further controlled trials are warranted .

title : Randomized comparison of C_C076029 versus C_D018967 for the treatment of first-episode D_D012559 : 4-month outcomes . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : The authors compared 4-month treatment outcomes for C_C076029 versus C_D018967 in patients with first-episode D_D012559 spectrum disorders . 
METHOD : One hundred twelve subjects ( 70 % male ; mean age=23.3 years [ SD = 5.1 ] ) with first-episode D_D012559 ( 75 % ) , D_D011618 ( 17 % ) , or D_D011618 ( 8 % ) were randomly assigned to treatment with C_C076029 ( 2.5-20 mg/day ) or C_D018967 ( 1-6 mg/day ) . 
RESULTS : Response rates did not significantly differ between C_C076029 ( 43.7 % , 95 % CI=28.8 % -58.6 % ) and C_D018967 ( 54.3 % , 95 % CI=39.9 % -68.7 % ) . 
Among those responding to treatment , more subjects in the C_C076029 group ( 40.9 % , 95 % CI=16.8 % -65.0 % ) than in the C_D018967 group ( 18.9 % , 95 % CI=0 % -39.2 % ) had subsequent ratings not meeting response criteria . 
Negative symptom outcomes and measures of D_D010302 and D_D017109 did not differ between medications . 
D_D001480 severity scores were 1.4 ( 95 % CI=1.2-1.6 ) with C_D018967 and 1.2 ( 95 % CI=1.0-1.4 ) with C_C076029 . 
Significantly more D_D015430 occurred with C_C076029 than with C_D018967 : the increase in weight at 4 months relative to baseline weight was 17.3 % ( 95 % CI=14.2 % -20.5 % ) with C_C076029 and 11.3 % ( 95 % CI=8.4 % -14.3 % ) with C_D018967 . 
Body mass index at baseline and at 4 months was 24.3 ( 95 % CI=22.8-25.7 ) versus 28.2 ( 95 % CI=26.7-29.7 ) with C_C076029 and 23.9 ( 95 % CI=22.5-25.3 ) versus 26.7 ( 95 % CI=25.2-28.2 ) with C_D018967 . 
CONCLUSIONS : Clinical outcomes with C_D018967 were equal to those with C_C076029 , and response may be more stable . 
C_C076029 may have an advantage for motor side effects . 
Both medications caused substantial rapid D_D015430 , but D_D015430 was greater with C_C076029 .

title : Early paracentral D_D014786 in patients taking C_D006886 . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : To review the natural history and ocular and systemic adverse effects of patients taking C_D006886 sulfate who attended an ophthalmic screening program . 
DESIGN : Retrospective study . 
RESULTS : Records of 262 patients who were taking C_D006886 and screened in the Department of Ophthalmology were reviewed . 
Of the 262 patients , 14 ( 18 % ) of 76 who had stopped treatment at the time of the study experienced documented adverse effects . 
Systemic adverse effects occurred in 8 patients ( 10.5 % ) and ocular adverse effects , in 5 ( 6.5 % ) . 
Thirty-five patients ( 13.4 % ) had D_D014786 , which were attributed to C_D006886 treatment in 4 patients ( 1.5 % ) . 
Three of the 4 patients were taking less than 6.5 mg/kg per day and all patients had normal renal and liver function test results . 
CONCLUSIONS : The current study used a protocol of visual acuity and color vision assessment , funduscopy , and Humphrey 10-2 visual field testing and shows that D_D014786 appeared before any corresponding changes in any other tested clinical parameters ; the defects were reproducible and the test parameters were reliable . 
Patients taking C_D006886 can demonstrate a toxic reaction in the retina despite the absence of known risk factors . 
Screening , including Humphrey 10-2 visual field assessment , is recommended 2 years after the initial baseline and yearly thereafter .

title : Peri-operative D_D054537 as a result of chemotherapy with C_D015251 and C_D017239 . 
abstract : A 47-year-old woman presented for mastectomy and immediate latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction having been diagnosed with D_D001943 6 months previously . 
In the preceding months she had received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with C_D015251 , C_D017239 ( C_D017239 ) and C_D003520 . 
This had been apparently uncomplicated and she had maintained a remarkably high level of physical activity . 
She was found to be D_D001919 at pre-operative assessment but had no cardiac symptoms . 
Second degree Mobitz type II D_D054537 was diagnosed on electrocardiogram , and temporary transvenous ventricular pacing instituted in the peri-operative period . 
We discuss how evidence-based guidelines would not have been helpful in this case , and how chemotherapy can exhibit substantial D_D066126 that may develop over many years . 
We suggest that patients who have received chemotherapy at any time should have a pre-operative electrocardiogram even if they are asymptomatic .

title : Risks and benefits of C_D052246 vs non-selective NSAIDs : does their cardiovascular risk exceed their gastrointestinal benefit ? 
A retrospective cohort study . 
abstract : OBJECTIVES : The risk of D_D009203 ( D_D009203 ) with C_D052246 may offset their gastrointestinal ( GI ) benefit compared with non-selective ( NS ) C_D000894 ( NSAIDs ) . 
We aimed to compare the risks of hospitalization for D_D009203 and D_D006471 among elderly patients using C_D052246 , NS-NSAIDs and C_D000082 . 
METHODS : We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data of patients > or =65 years of age who filled a prescription for NSAID or C_D000082 during 1999-2002 . 
Outcomes were compared using Cox regression models with time-dependent exposures . 
RESULTS : Person-years of exposure among non-users of C_D001241 were : 75,761 to C_D000082 , 42,671 to C_C116926 65,860 to C_C105934 , and 37,495 to NS-NSAIDs . 
Among users of C_D001241 , they were : 14,671 to C_C116926 , 22,875 to C_C105934 , 9,832 to NS-NSAIDs and 38,048 to C_D000082 . 
Among non-users of C_D001241 , the adjusted hazard ratios ( 95 % confidence interval ) of hospitalization for D_D009203/GI vs the C_D000082 ( with no C_D001241 ) group were : C_C116926 1.27 ( 1.13 , 1.42 ) , C_C105934 0.93 ( 0.83 , 1.03 ) , C_D009288 1.59 ( 1.31 , 1.93 ) , C_D004008 1.17 ( 0.99 , 1.38 ) and C_D007052 1.05 ( 0.74 , 1.51 ) . 
Among users of C_D001241 , they were : C_C116926 1.73 ( 1.52 , 1.98 ) , C_C105934 1.34 ( 1.19 , 1.52 ) , C_D007052 1.51 ( 0.95 , 2.41 ) , C_D004008 1.69 ( 1.35 , 2.10 ) , C_D009288 1.35 ( 0.97 , 1.88 ) and C_D000082 1.29 ( 1.17 , 1.42 ) . 
CONCLUSION : Among non-users of C_D001241 , C_D009288 seemed to carry the highest risk for D_D009203/D_D006471 . 
The D_D009203/GI D_D064420 of C_C105934 was similar to that of C_D000082 and seemed to be better than those of C_C116926 and NS-NSAIDs . 
Among users of C_D001241 , both C_C105934 and C_D009288 seemed to be the least toxic .

title : C_D011803-induced D_D001145 in a patient with D_D016778 . 
abstract : It was reported that there was a case of D_D016778 patient with D_D007565 who presented with D_D001145 ( D_D018879 ) while getting C_D011803 infusion was reported . 
A man , 25 years old , was admitted to hospital with high D_D005334 , D_D023341 , D_D014839 , D_D007565 . 
The patient was fully conscious , blood pressure 120/80 mmHg , pulse rate 100 x/minute , regular . 
On admission , laboratory examination showed Plasmodium falciparum ( ++++ ) , total C_D001663 8.25 mg/dL , conjugated C_D001663 4.36 mg/dL , unconjugated C_D001663 3.89 mg/dL , C_D011188 3.52 meq/L Patient was diagnosed as D_D016778 with D_D007565 and got C_D011803 infusion in C_D005947 5 % 500 mg/8 hour . 
On the second day the patient had D_D014839 , D_D003967 , D_D014012 , D_D034381 . 
After 30 hours of C_D011803 infusion the patient felt D_-1 and electrocardiography ( ECG ) recording showed D_D018879 ( D_D018879 ) > 5 x/minute , trigemini , constant type -- D_D012848 , positive U wave . 
He was treated with C_D008012 50 mg intravenously followed by infusion 1500 mg in C_D005947 5 % /24 hour and C_D011188 aspartate tablet . 
C_D011803 infusion was discontinued and changed with sulfate C_D011803 tablets . 
Three hours later the patient felt better , the frequency of D_D018879 reduced to 4 - 5 x/minute and on the third day ECG was normal , C_D011188 level was 3.34 meq/L . 
He was discharged on 7th day in good condition . 
C_D011803 , like C_D011802 , is a chincona alkaloid that has anti-D_D001145 property , although it also pro-D_D001145 that can cause various D_D001145s , including severe D_D001145 such as multiple D_D018879 . 
Administration of parenteral C_D011803 must be done carefully and with good observation because of its pro-D_D001145 effect , especially in older patients who have D_D006331 or patients with D_D014883 ( D_D007008 ) which frequently occurs due to D_D014839 and or D_D003967 in D_D008288 cases .

title : C_D010396-related D_D017512 and utility of C_D019345 in a D_D006527 patient with hepatic presentation , D_D001008 and SPECT abnormalities . 
abstract : D_D006527 is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic C_D003300 metabolism with consequent C_D003300 accumulation and D_D064420 in many tissues and consequent hepatic , neurologic and psychiatric disorders . 
We report a case of D_D006527 with D_D008107 ; moreover , in our patient , presenting also with high levels of state D_D001008 without D_D003866 , 99mTc-ECD-SPECT showed cortical hypoperfusion in frontal lobes , more marked on the left frontal lobe . 
During the follow-up of our patient , C_D010396 was interrupted after the appearance of a D_D017512 , and C_D019345 permitted to continue the successful treatment of the patient without side-effects . 
In our case the therapy with C_D019345 represented an effective treatment for a D_D006527 patient in which C_D010396-related side effects appeared . 
The safety of the C_D019345 allowed us to avoid other potentially toxic chelating drugs ; this observation is in line with the growing evidence on the efficacy of the drug in the treatment of D_D006527 . 
Since most of D_D006527 C_D010396-treated patients do not seem to develop this D_D012871 , it could be conceivable that a specific genetic factor is involved in drug response . 
Further studies are needed for a better clarification of D_D006527 therapy , and in particular to differentiate specific therapies for different D_D006527 phenotypes .

title : A dramatic D_D007022 following prehospital C_D005996 administration . 
abstract : A male in his sixties with no history of cardiac D_D002637 awoke with D_D002637 following an afternoon sleep . 
The patient did not self medicate . 
The patient 's observations were within normal limits , he was administered C_D010100 via a face mask and C_D005996 ( C_D005996 ) . 
Several minutes after the C_D005996 the patient experienced a sudden D_D007022 and heart rate , this was rectified by C_D001285 and a fluid challenge . 
There was no further deterioration in the patient 's condition during transport to hospital . 
There are very few documented case like this in the prehospital scientific literature . 
The cause appears to be the Bezold-Jarish reflex , stimulation of the ventricular walls which in turn decreases sympathetic outflow from the vasomotor centre . 
Prehospital care providers who are managing any patient with a D_D013575 that fails to recover within a reasonable time frame should consider the Bezold-Jarisch reflex as the cause and manage the patient accordingly .

title : Comparison of C_C081489/C_D006852 combination therapy at doses up to 320/25 mg versus monotherapy : a double-blind , placebo-controlled study followed by long-term combination therapy in D_D006973 adults . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : One third of patients treated for D_D006973 attain adequate blood pressure ( BP ) control , and multidrug regimens are often required . 
Given the lifelong nature of D_D006973 , there is a need to evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of higher doses of combination anti-D_D006973 therapies . 
OBJECTIVE : This study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of C_C081489 ( C_C081489 ) or C_D006852 ( C_D006852 ) -monotherapy and higher-dose combinations in patients with essential D_D006973 . 
METHODS : The first part of this study was an 8-week , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo controlled , parallel-group trial . 
Patients with essential D_D006973 ( mean sitting diastolic BP [ MSDBP ] , > or =95 mm Hg and < 110 mm Hg ) were randomized to 1 of 8 treatment groups : C_C081489 160 or 320 mg ; C_D006852 12.5 or 25 mg ; C_C081489/C_D006852 160/12.5 , 320/12.5 , or 320/25 mg ; or placebo . 
Mean changes in MSDBP and mean sitting systolic BP ( MSSBP ) were analyzed at the 8-week core study end point . 
C_C081489/C_D006852 320/12.5 and 320/25 mg were further investigated in a 54-week , open-label extension . 
Response was defined as MSDBP < 90 mm Hg or a > or =10 mm Hg decrease compared to baseline . 
Control was defined as MSDBP < 90 mm Hg compared with baseline . 
Tolerability was assessed by monitoring adverse events at randomization and all subsequent study visits and regular evaluation of hematology and blood chemistry . 
RESULTS : A total of 1346 patients were randomized into the 8-week core study ( 734 men , 612 women ; 924 white , 291 black , 23 Asian , 108 other ; mean age , 52.7 years ; mean weight , 92.6 kg ) . 
All active treatments were associated with significantly reduced MSSBP and MSDBP during the core 8-week study , with each monotherapy significantly contributing to the overall effect of combination therapy ( C_C081489 and C_D006852 , P < 0.001 ) . 
Each combination was associated with significantly greater reductions in MSSBP and MSDBP compared with the monotherapies and placebo ( all , P < 0.001 ) . 
The mean reduction in MSSBP/MSDBP with C_C081489/C_D006852 320/25 mg was 24.7/16.6 mm Hg , compared with 5.9/7.0 mm Hg with placebo . 
The reduction in MSSBP was significantly greater with C_C081489/C_D006852 320/25 mg compared with C_C081489/C_D006852 160/12.5 mg ( P < 0.002 ) . 
Rates of response and BP control were significantly higher in the groups that received combination treatment compared with those that received monotherapy . 
The incidence of D_D007008 was lower with C_C081489/C_D006852 combinations ( 1.8 % -6.1 % ) than with C_D006852 monotherapies ( 7.1 % -13.3 % ) . 
The majority of adverse events in the core study were of mild to moderate severity . 
The efficacy and tolerability of C_C081489/C_D006852 combinations were maintained during the extension ( 797 patients ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : In this study population , combination therapies with C_C081489/C_D006852 were associated with significantly greater BP reductions compared with either monotherapy , were well tolerated , and were associated with less D_D007008 than C_D006852 alone .

title : C_D004113 chelation improves learning , attention , and arousal regulation in C_D007854-exposed rats but produces lasting D_D003072 in the absence of C_D007854 exposure . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood C_D007854 levels . 
However , very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in C_D007854-exposed children , or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of C_D007854 exposure . 
OBJECTIVES : The present study was designed to answer these questions , using a rodent model of early childhood C_D007854 exposure and treatment with C_D004113 , a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of C_D007854 poisoning . 
RESULTS : C_D007854 exposure produced lasting impairments in learning , attention , inhibitory control , and arousal regulation , paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in C_D007854-exposed children . 
C_D004113 treatment of the C_D007854-exposed rats significantly improved learning , attention , and arousal regulation , although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the C_D007854 exposure level and the specific functional deficit . 
In contrast , C_D004113 treatment of rats not previously exposed to C_D007854 produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher C_D007854 exposure regimen . 
CONCLUSIONS : These are the first data , to our knowledge , to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate D_D003072 due to C_D007854 exposure . 
These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a C_D004113 treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in C_D007854-exposed children . 
However , they also suggest that C_D004113 treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of C_D007854 or other heavy metals .

title : C_D002110 challenge test in D_D016584 and D_D003866 with D_D016584 . 
abstract : Our aim was to observe if patients with D_D016584 ( D_D016584 ) and patients with major D_D003866 with D_D016584 ( D_D003865|D016584 ) ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of D_D001523 , Fourth Edition criteria ) respond in a similar way to the induction of D_D016584 by an oral C_D002110 challenge test . 
We randomly selected 29 patients with D_D016584 , 27 with D_D003865|D016584 , 25 with major D_D003866 without D_D016584 ( D_D003865 ) , and 28 healthy volunteers . 
The patients had no psychotropic drug for at least a 4-week period . 
In a randomized double-blind experiment performed in 2 occasions 7 days apart , 480 mg C_D002110 and a C_D002110-free ( placebo ) solution were administered in a coffee form and D_D001008 scales were applied before and after each test . 
A total of 58.6 % ( n = 17 ) of patients with D_D016584 , 44.4 % ( n = 12 ) of patients with D_D003865|D016584 , 12.0 % ( n = 3 ) of patients with D_D003865 , and 7.1 % ( n= 2 ) of control subjects had a D_D016584 after the 480-mg C_D002110 challenge test ( chi ( 2 ) ( 3 ) = 16.22 , P = .001 ) . 
The patients with D_D016584 and D_D003865|D016584 were more sensitive to C_D002110 than were patients with D_D003865 and healthy volunteers . 
No D_D016584 was observed after the C_D002110-free solution intake . 
The patients with D_D003865 had a lower heart rate response to the test than all the other groups ( 2-way analysis of variance , group by time interaction with Greenhouse-Geisser correction : F ( 3,762 ) = 2.85 , P = .026 ) . 
Our data suggest that there is an association between D_D016584 , no matter if associated with D_D016584 or D_D003865|D016584 , and hyperreactivity to an oral C_D002110 challenge test .

title : Mitral annuloplasty as a ventricular restoration method for the D_D006333 : a pilot study . 
abstract : BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY : Undersized mitral annuloplasty ( MAP ) is effective in patients with D_D002311 and functional D_D008944 ( D_D008944 ) since , as well as addressing the D_D008944 , the MAP may also reshape the dilated left ventricular ( LV ) base . 
However , the direct benefits of this possible reshaping on LV function in the absence of underlying D_D008944 remain incompletely understood . 
The study aim was to identify these benefits in a canine model of acute D_D006333 . 
METHODS : Six dogs underwent MAP with a prosthetic band on the posterior mitral annulus , using four mattress sutures . 
The sutures were passed individually through four tourniquets and exteriorized untied via the left atriotomy . 
Sonomicrometry crystals were implanted around the mitral annulus and left ventricle to measure geometry and regional function . 
Acute D_D006333 was induced by C_D011433 and volume loading after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass ; an absence of D_D008944 was confirmed by echocardiography . 
MAP was accomplished by cinching the tourniquets . 
Data were acquired at baseline , after induction of acute D_D006333 , and after MAP . 
RESULTS : MAP decreased mitral annular dimensions in both commissure-commissure and septal-lateral directions . 
Concomitantly , the diastolic diameter of the LV base and LV sphericity decreased ( i.e. , improved ) from 37.4 +/- 9.3 to 35.9 +/- 10 mm ( p = 0.063 ) , and from 67.9 +/- 18.6 % to 65.3 +/- 18.9 % ( p = 0.016 ) , respectively . 
Decreases were evident in both LV end-diastolic pressure ( from 17 +/- 7 to 15 +/- 6 mmHg , p = 0.0480 and Tau ( from 48 +/- 8 to 45 +/- 8 ms , p < 0.01 ) , while fractional shortening at the LV base increased from 7.7 +/- 4.5 % to 9.4 +/- 4.5 % ( p = 0.045 ) . 
After MAP , increases were identified in both cardiac output ( from 1.54 +/- 0.57 to 1.65 +/- 0.57 1/min ) and Emax ( from 1.86 +/- 0.9 to 2.41 +/- 1.31 mmHg/ml ) . 
CONCLUSION : The data acquired suggest that isolated MAP may have certain benefits on LV dimension/function in acute D_D006333 , even in the absence of D_D008944 . 
However , further investigations are warranted in a model of chronic D_D006333 .

title : C_C085143-induced D_D012640 rapidly reversed by high flux hemodialysis in a patient on peritoneal dialysis . 
abstract : Despite popular use of C_D010878 , the dire D_D020258 associated with C_D010878 still goes unrecognized , leading to a delay in appropriate management . 
We report a 57-year-old woman with D_D007676 receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) , who developed slurred speech , D_D014202 , bizarre behavior , progressive mental D_D003221 , and 2 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic D_D012640 ( D_D004830 ) after 5 doses of C_D010878/tazobactam ( 2 g/250 mg ) were given for D_D001987 with D_D060085 . 
The laboratory data revealed normal plasma electrolyte and C_D000641 levels but D_D007964 . 
Neurologic examinations showed D_D004401 and bilateral Babinski sign . 
Computed tomography of brain and electroencephalogram were unremarkable . 
Despite the use of antiepileptic agents , another D_D004830 episode recurred after the sixth dose of C_D010878/tazobactam . 
Brain magnetic resonance imaging did not demonstrate acute D_D007238 and D_-1 . 
Initiation of high-flux hemodialysis rapidly reversed the neurologic symptoms within 4 hours . 
C_D010878-induced D_D001927 should be considered in any D_D006463 patients with unexplained neurological manifestations . 
CAPD is inefficient in removing C_D010878 , whereas hemodialysis can rapidly terminate the C_D010878-induced D_D001927 .

title : Frequency of transient ipsilateral D_D014826 in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Especially because of improvements in clinical neurologic monitoring , carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia has become the technique of choice in several centers . 
Temporary ipsilateral D_D014826 due to local anesthetics have been described , however . 
Such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre-existing contralateral D_D010243 . 
We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences . 
METHODS : This prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia . 
Vocal cord function was evaluated before , during , and after surgery ( postoperative day 1 ) using flexible laryngoscopy . 
Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long-acting ( C_C037663 ) and short-acting ( C_D011318 ) anesthetic . 
RESULTS : All patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively . 
Twelve patients ( 43 % ) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral D_D014826 . 
It resolved in all cases < or =24 hours . 
There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary D_D014826 compared with those without . 
CONCLUSION : Local anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral D_D014826 in almost half of these patients . 
Because pre-existing D_D010243 is of a relevant frequency ( up to 3 % ) , a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral D_D010243 . 
In patients with preoperative contralateral D_D014826 , surgery under general anesthesia should be considered .

title : Neuroprotective effects of C_D008550 upon the offspring cerebellar cortex in the rat model of C_D002330-induced D_D054220 . 
abstract : D_D054220 is a malformation characterized by defects in proliferation , migration and maturation . 
This study was designed to evaluate the alterations in offspring rat cerebellum induced by maternal exposure to C_D002330- [ C_D002330 ] ( C_D002330 ) and to investigate the effects of exogenous C_D008550 upon cerebellar C_D002330-induced D_D054220 , using histological and biochemical analyses . 
Pregnant Wistar rats were assigned to five groups : intact-control , saline-control , C_D008550-treated , C_D002330-exposed and C_D002330-exposed plus C_D008550 . 
Rats were exposed to C_D002330 on embryonic day 15 and C_D008550 was given until delivery . 
Immuno/histochemistry and electron microscopy were carried out on the offspring cerebellum , and levels of C_D008315 and C_D013481 dismutase were determined . 
Histopathologically , typical findings were observed in the cerebella from the control groups , but the findings consistent with early embryonic development were noted in C_D002330-exposed D_D054220 group . 
There was a marked increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells and nestin positive cells in C_D002330-exposed group , but a decreased immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein , synaptophysin and transforming growth factor beta1 was observed , indicating a delayed maturation , and C_D008550 significantly reversed these changes . 
C_D008315 level in C_D002330-exposed group was higher than those in control groups and C_D008550 decreased C_D008315 levels in C_D002330 group ( P < 0.01 ) , while there were no significant differences in the C_D013481 dismutase levels between these groups . 
These data suggest that exposure of animals to C_D002330 during pregnancy leads to delayed maturation of offspring cerebellum and C_D008550 protects the cerebellum against the effects of C_D002330 .

title : C_C002647 ( C_C002647 ) synthase inhibition : in-vivo study in rats . 
abstract : C_D008094 and C_D014635 are the prototypic mood stabilizers and have diverse structures and targets . 
Both drugs influence C_D007294 metabolism . 
C_D008094 inhibits IMPase and C_D014635 inhibits C_C002647 synthase . 
This study shows that C_C002647 synthase inhibition does not replicate or augment the effects of C_D008094 in the C_D007294 sensitive C_D010862-induced D_D012640 model . 
This lack of effects may stem from the low contribution of de-novo synthesis to cellular C_D007294 supply or to the inhibition of the de-novo synthesis by C_D008094 itself .

title : Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-associated acute D_D009395 with granular tubular basement membrane deposits . 
abstract : Acute tubulo-D_D009395 ( D_C564356 ) is an important cause of D_D058186 resulting from a variety of insults , including immune complex-mediated D_D009395 , but drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) are a far more frequent cause . 
Overall , as an entity , D_C564356 remains under-diagnosed , as symptoms resolve spontaneously if the medication is stopped . 
We report on a 14-year-old boy who developed D_D058186 2 weeks after aortic valve surgery . 
He was put on C_D001241 following surgery and took C_D007052 for D_D005334 for nearly a week prior to presentation . 
He then presented to the emergency department feeling quite ill and was found to have a C_D001806 ( C_D001806 ) concentration of of 147 mg/dl , C_D003404 of 15.3 mg/dl and serum C_D011188 of 8.7 mEq/l . 
Dialysis was immediately initiated . 
A kidney biopsy showed inflammatory infiltrate consistent with D_C564356 . 
However , in the tubular basement membrane ( TBM ) , very intense granular deposits of polyclonal IgG and C3 were noted . 
He needed dialysis for 2 weeks and was treated successfully with C_D013256 for 6 months . 
His renal recovery and disappearance of D_D011507 took a year . 
In conclusion , this is a first report of NSAIDs-associated D_C564356 , showing deposits of granular immune complex present only in the TBM and not in the glomeruli .

title : Rate of YMDD motif mutants in C_D019259-untreated Iranian patients with D_D019694 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : C_D019259 is used for the treatment of D_D019694 patients . 
Recent studies show that the YMDD motif mutants ( resistant D_D006509 virus ) occur as natural genome variability in C_D019259-untreated D_D019694 patients . 
In this study we aimed to determine the rate of YMDD motif mutants in C_D019259-untreated D_D019694 patients in Iran . 
PATIENTS AND METHODS : A total of 77 D_D019694 patients who had not been treated with C_D019259 were included in the study . 
Serum samples from patients were tested by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) for detection of YMDD motif mutants . 
All patients were also tested for liver enzymes , anti-HCV , C_D006513 , and anti-HBe . 
RESULTS : Of the 77 patients enrolled in the study , 73 % were male and 27 % were female . 
Mean ALT and AST levels were 124.4+/-73.4 and 103.1+/-81 IU/l , respectively . 
C_D006513 was positive in 40 % and anti-HBe in 60 % of the patients . 
Anti-HCV was negative in all of them . 
YMDD motif mutants were not detected in any of the patients despite the liver enzyme levels and the presence of C_D006513 or anti-HBe . 
CONCLUSION : Although the natural occurrence of YMDD motif mutants in C_D019259-untreated patients with D_D019694 has been reported , these mutants were not detected in Iranian C_D019259-untreated D_D019694 patients .

title : The differential effects of C_D002045 and C_D008012 on C_D015232 release , cyclooxygenase gene expression and D_D010146 in a clinical D_D010146 model . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites , long-acting local anesthetics might directly modulate D_D007249 . 
In the present study , we describe the proinflammatory effects of C_D002045 on local C_D015232 ( C_D015232 ) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) gene expression that increases postoperative D_D010146 in human subjects . 
METHODS : Subjects ( n = 114 ) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2 % C_D008012 or 0.5 % C_D002045 before surgery and either C_C116926 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h. Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery . 
After extraction , a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for C_D015232 and C_D013929 ( C_D013929 ) measurements . 
RESULTS : The C_D002045/C_C116926 group reported significantly less D_D010146 , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h. However , the C_D002045/placebo group reported significantly more D_D010146 at 24 h and C_D015232 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups . 
Moreover , C_D002045 significantly increased COX-2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the C_D008012/placebo group . 
C_D013931 levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments , indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX-2 , but not COX-1 . 
CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that C_D002045 stimulates COX-2 gene expression after D_D017695 , which is associated with higher C_D015232 production and D_D010146 after the local anesthetic effect dissipates .

title : p75NTR expression in rat urinary bladder sensory neurons and spinal cord with C_D003520-induced D_D003556 . 
abstract : A role for nerve growth factor ( NGF ) in contributing to increased voiding frequency and altered sensation from the urinary bladder has been suggested . 
Previous studies have examined the expression and regulation of C_D014443 kinase receptors ( Trks ) in micturition reflexes with D_D003556 . 
The present studies examine the expression and regulation of another receptor known to bind NGF , p75 ( NTR ) , after various durations of D_D003556 induced by C_D003520 ( C_D003520 ) . 
C_D003520-induced D_D003556 increased ( P < or = 0.001 ) p75 ( NTR ) expression in the superficial lateral and medial dorsal horn in L1-L2 and L6-S1 spinal segments . 
The number of p75 ( NTR ) -immunoreactive ( -IR ) cells in the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia ( DRG ) also increased ( P < or = 0.05 ) with C_D003520-induced D_D003556 ( acute , intermediate , and chronic ) . 
Quantitative , real-time polymerase chain reaction also demonstrated significant increases ( P < or = 0.01 ) in p75 ( NTR ) mRNA in DRG with intermediate and chronic C_D003520-induced D_D003556 . 
Retrograde dye-tracing techniques with Fastblue were used to identify presumptive bladder afferent cells in the lumbosacral DRG . 
In bladder afferent cells in DRG , p75 ( NTR ) -IR was also increased ( P < or = 0.01 ) with D_D003556 . 
In addition to increases in p75 ( NTR ) -IR in DRG cell bodies , increases ( P < or = 0.001 ) in pericellular ( encircling DRG cells ) p75 ( NTR ) -IR in DRG also increased . 
Confocal analyses demonstrated that pericellular p75 ( NTR ) -IR was not colocalized with the glial marker , glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) . 
These studies demonstrate that p75 ( NTR ) expression in micturition reflexes is present constitutively and modified by D_D003556 . 
The functional significance of p75 ( NTR ) expression in micturition reflexes remains to be determined .

title : C_D001379-induced suicidal erythrocyte death . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : C_D001379 is widely used as an immunosuppressive drug . 
The side effects of C_D001379 include D_D000740 , which has been attributed to bone marrow suppression . 
Alternatively , D_D000740 could result from accelerated suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis , which is characterized by exposure of C_D010718 ( C_D010718 ) at the erythrocyte surface and by cell shrinkage . 
METHODS : The present experiments explored whether C_D001379 influences eryptosis . 
According to annexin V binding , erythrocytes from patients indeed showed a significant increase of C_D010718 exposure within 1 week of treatment with C_D001379 . 
In a second series , cytosolic C_D0021182+ activity ( C_C059715 fluorescence ) , cell volume ( forward scatter ) , and C_D010718-exposure ( annexin V binding ) were determined by FACS analysis in erythrocytes from healthy volunteers . 
RESULTS : Exposure to C_D001379 ( > or =2 microg/mL ) for 48 hours increased cytosolic C_D0021182+ activity and annexin V binding and decreased forward scatter . 
The effect of C_D001379 on both annexin V binding and forward scatter was significantly blunted in the nominal absence of extracellular C_D0021182+ . 
CONCLUSIONS : C_D001379 triggers suicidal erythrocyte death , an effect presumably contributing to C_D001379-induced D_D000740 .

title : Clinical comparison of cardiorespiratory effects during unilateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Spinal anaesthesia is widely employed in clinical practice but has the main drawback of post-spinal block D_D007022 . 
Efforts must therefore continue to be made to obviate this setback OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the cardiovascular and respiratory changes during unilateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia . 
METHODS : With ethical approval , we studied 74 American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) , physical status class 1 and 2 patients scheduled for elective unilateral lower limb surgery . 
Patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups : lateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia groups . 
In the lateral position with operative side down , patients recived 10 mg ( 2mls ) of 0.5 % hyperbaric C_D002045 through a 25-gauge spinal needle . 
Patients in the unilateral group were maintained in the lateral position for 15 minutes following spinal injection while those in the conventional group were turned supine immediately after injection . 
Blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate and C_D010100 saturation were monitored over 1 hour . 
RESULTS : Three patients ( 8.1 % ) in the unilateral group and 5 ( 13.5 % ) in the conventional group developed D_D007022 , P= 0.71 . 
Four ( 10.8 % ) patients in the conventional group and 1 ( 2.7 % ) in the unilateral group , P= 0.17 required C_D004837 infusion to treat D_D007022 . 
Patients in the conventional group had statistically significant greater fall in the systolic blood pressures at 15 , 30 and 45 minutes when compared to the baseline ( P= 0.003 , 0.001 and 0.004 ) . 
The mean respiratory rate and C_D010100 saturations in the two groups were similar . 
CONCLUSION : Compared to conventional spinal anaesthesia , unilateral spinal anaesthesia was associated with fewer cardiovascular perturbations . 
Also , the type of spinal block instituted affected neither the respiratory rate nor the arterial C_D010100 saturation .

The most common regimens were C_D019259 + C_D018119 + C_D019829 ( C_D019829 ) ( 54.8 % ) , C_D015215 ( C_D015215 ) + C_D019259 + C_D019829 ( 14.5 % ) , C_D019259 + C_D018119 + C_C098320 ( C_C098320 ) ( 20.1 % ) , and C_D015215 + C_D019259 + C_C098320 ( 5.4 % ) . 
The most common adverse events and median CD4 at time of event were D_D005076 ( 15.2 % ; CD4 , 285 cells/microL ) and D_D010523 ( 9.0 % and 348 cells/microL ) . 
Clinically significant D_D000740 ( hemoglobin < 7 g/dL ) was observed in 5.4 % of patients ( CD4 , 165 cells/microL ) and D_D056486 ( clinical D_D007565 with C_D000409 aminotransferase > 5 times upper limits of normal ) in 3.5 % of patients ( CD4 , 260 cells/microL ) . 
Women were significantly more likely to experience D_D000140 , while men were significantly more likely to experience D_D054019 ( p < 0.05 ) . 
Among the patients with 1 year of follow-up , C_D019829 therapy was significantly associated with developing D_D005076 and C_D018119 therapy with developing D_D010523 ( p < 0.05 ) . 
D_D000740 and D_D056486 often occur within 12 weeks of initiating generic HAART . 
Frequent and early monitoring for these D_D064420 is warranted in developing countries where generic HAART is increasingly available .

title : C_D013792 and D_D010523 : a neurophysiological study . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Recent studies confirmed a high incidence of D_D010523 in patients treated with different doses of C_D013792 . 
The study 's aims were to measure variations in sural nerve sensory action potential ( SAP ) amplitude in patients with refractory D_D008178 ( D_D008178 ) treated with C_D013792 and use these findings to identify the D_D020258 potential of C_D013792 and the recovery capacity of sensory fibres after discontinuation of treatment . 
PATIENTS AND METHODS : Clinical and electrophysiological data in 12 female patients with D_D008178 during treatment with C_D013792 and up to 47 months after discontinuation of treatment were analysed . 
Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction > or =40 % was the criteria for discontinuing therapy . 
RESULTS : During treatment , 11 patients showed a reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude compared to baseline values ( 9 with a reduction > or =50 % and 2 < 50 % ) . 
One patient showed no changes in SAP amplitude . 
Five patients complained of D_D010292 and leg D_D009120 . 
After C_D013792 treatment , sural SAP amplitude recovered in 3 patients . 
At detection of reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude , the median C_D013792 cumulative dose was 21.4 g. The threshold D_D020258 dosage is lower than previously reported . 
CONCLUSIONS : Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction is a reliable and sensitive marker of degeneration and recovery of sensory fibres . 
This electrophysiological parameter provides information about subclinical D_D020258 potential of C_D013792 but is not helpful in predicting the appearance of sensory symptoms .

title : C_D000638-related D_D055370 and unique D_D015433 in a patient with D_D006349 : Diagnostic pitfall and new findings . 
abstract : C_D000638 is an anti-D_D001145 drug for life-threatening D_D013610 , but various adverse effects have been reported . 
Reported herein is an autopsy case of D_D006349 , in a patient who developed a D_D055370 ( 1.5 cm in diameter ) and D_D011507 ( 2.76 g/day ) after treatment with C_D000638 for a long time . 
The D_D055370 was highly suspected to be D_D008175 on CT and positron emission tomography , but histologically the lesion was composed of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in alveolar walls and intra-alveolar accumulation of foamy macrophages containing characteristic myelinoid bodies , indicating that it was an C_D000638-related lesion . 
In addition , the lung tissue had unevenly distributed D_D006486 deposition , and abnormally tortuous capillaries were seen in the mass and in heavily D_D006486 lung portions outside the mass . 
In the kidneys , glomeruli had membrane spikes , prominent swelling of podocytes and subepithelial deposits , which were sometimes large and hump-like . 
D_D001327 , D_D006525 , malignant D_D009369 or other diseases with a known relationship to D_D015433 were not found . 
The present case highlights the possibility that differential diagnosis between an C_D000638-related D_D055370 and a D_D009369 can be very difficult radiologically , and suggests that D_D015433 might be another possible complication of C_D000638 treatment .

title : Risk of D_D003324 associated with initial C_-1 treatment of patients with D_D003924 : a matched case-control study . 
abstract : AIMS : This study sought to assess the risk of developing D_D003324 ( D_D003324 ) associated with initial treatment of D_D003924 with different C_-1s . 
METHODS : In D_D003924 patients , cases who developed D_D003324 were compared retrospectively with controls that did not . 
The 20-year risk of D_D003324 at diagnosis of D_D003920 , using the UKPDS risk engine , was used to match cases with controls . 
RESULTS : The 76 cases of D_D003324 were compared with 152 controls . 
The hazard of developing D_D003324 ( 95 % CI ) associated with initial treatment increased by 2.4-fold ( 1.3-4.3 , P=0.004 ) with C_D005905 ; 2-fold ( 0.9-4.6 , P=0.099 ) with C_D005913 ; 2.9-fold ( 1.6-5.1 , P=0.000 ) with either , and was unchanged with C_D008687 . 
The hazard decreased 0.3-fold ( 0.7-1.7 , P=0.385 ) with C_C057619 , 0.4-fold ( 0.7-1.3 , P=0.192 ) with C_D005907 , and 0.4-fold ( 0.7-1.1 , P=0.09 ) with either . 
CONCLUSIONS : Initiating treatment of D_D003924 with C_D005905 or C_D005913 is associated with increased risk of D_D003324 in comparison to C_D005907 or C_C057619 . 
If confirmed , this may be important because most Indian patients receive the cheaper older C_-1s , and present guidelines do not distinguish between individual agents .

title : Reduced progression of C_D004317 D_D007674 in spontaneously D_D006973 rats treated by C_D019808 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : The aim of the study was to investigate the antiD_D006973 effects of C_D000804 type-1 receptor blocker , C_D019808 , and its potential in slowing down D_D007674 progression in spontaneously D_D006973 rats ( SHR ) with C_D004317 ( C_D004317 ) D_D007674 . 
METHODS : Six-month-old female SHR were randomly selected in six groups . 
Two control groups ( SH ( 6 ) , SH ( 12 ) ) received vehicle . 
Groups C_D004317 ( 6 ) , C_D004317+C_D019808 ( 6 ) and C_D004317 ( 12 ) , and C_D004317+C_D019808 ( 12 ) received C_D004317 ( 2 mg/kg/b.w . 
i.v . ) 
twice in a 3-week interval . 
Group C_D004317+C_D019808 ( 6 ) received C_D019808 ( 10 mg/kg/b.w./day by gavages ) for 6 weeks and group C_D004317+C_D019808 ( 12 ) for 12 weeks after second injection of C_D004317 . 
Animals were killed after 6 or 12 weeks , respectively . 
Haemodynamic measurements were performed on anaesthetized animals , blood and urine samples were taken for biochemical analysis and the left kidney was processed for morphological studies . 
RESULTS : Short-term C_D019808 treatment , besides antiD_D006973 effect , improved glomerular filtration rate and ameliorated D_D005921 resulting in decreased D_D011507 . 
Prolonged treatment with C_D019808 showed further reduction of D_D005921 associated with reduced progression of tubular D_D001284 and D_D005355 , thus preventing heavy D_D011507 and D_D007676 . 
C_D019808 reduced D_D014511 and increased C_D014508 clearance in advanced C_D004317 D_D007674 in SHR . 
Histological examination showed that C_D019808 could prevent tubular D_D001284 , interstitial infiltration and D_D005355 in C_D004317 D_D007674 . 
CONCLUSION : C_D019808 reduces the rate of progression of C_D004317-induced focal segmental D_D005921 to end-stage D_D007674 in SHR .

title : The risks of aprotinin and C_D014148 in cardiac surgery : a one-year follow-up of 1188 consecutive patients . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Our aim was to investigate postoperative complications and mortality after administration of aprotinin compared to C_D014148 in an unselected , consecutive cohort . 
METHODS : Perioperative data from consecutive cardiac surgery patients were prospectively collected between September 2005 and June 2006 in a university-affiliated clinic ( n = 1188 ) . 
During the first 5 mo , 596 patients received aprotinin ( Group A ) ; in the next 5 mo , 592 patients were treated with C_D014148 ( Group T ) . 
Except for antifibrinolytic therapy , the anesthetic and surgical protocols remained unchanged . 
RESULTS : The pre- and intraoperative variables were comparable between the treatment groups . 
Postoperatively , a significantly higher incidence of D_D012640 was found in Group T ( 4.6 % vs 1.2 % , P < 0.001 ) . 
This difference was also significant in the primary valve surgery and the high risk surgery subgroups ( 7.9 % vs 1.2 % , P = 0.003 ; 7.3 % vs 2.4 % , P = 0.035 , respectively ) . 
Persistent atrial fibrillation ( 7.9 % vs 2.3 % , P = 0.020 ) and D_D051437 ( 9.7 % vs 1.7 % , P = 0.002 ) were also more common in Group T , in the primary valve surgery subgroup . 
On the contrary , among primary coronary artery bypass surgery patients , there were more acute D_D009203 and D_D007674 in Group A ( 5.8 % vs 2.0 % , P = 0.027 ; 22.5 % vs 15.2 % , P = 0.036 , respectively ) . 
The 1-yr mortality was significantly higher after aprotinin treatment in the high risk surgery group ( 17.7 % vs 9.8 % , P = 0.034 ) . 
CONCLUSION : Both antifibrinolytic drugs bear the risk of adverse outcome depending on the type of cardiac surgery . 
Administration of aprotinin should be avoided in coronary artery bypass graft and high risk patients , whereas administration of C_D014148 is not recommended in valve surgery .

title : The biological properties of the optical isomers of C_D011433 and their effects on D_D001145 . 
abstract : 1 . 
The optical isomers of C_D011433 have been compared for their beta-blocking and antiarrhythmic activities.2 . 
In blocking the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to C_D007545 , ( + ) -C_D011433 had less than one hundredth the potency of ( - ) -C_D011433 . 
At dose levels of ( + ) -C_D011433 which attenuated the responses to C_D007545 , there was a significant prolongation of the PR interval of the electrocardiogram.3 . 
The metabolic responses to C_D007545 in dogs ( an increase in circulating C_D005947 , C_D019344 and free C_D005227 ) were all blocked by ( - ) -C_D011433 . 
( + ) -C_D011433 had no effect on C_D005227 mobilization but significantly reduced the increments in both C_D019344 and C_D005947.4 . 
Both isomers of C_D011433 possessed similar depressant potency on isolated atrial muscle taken from guinea-pigs.5 . 
The isomers of C_D011433 exhibited similar local anaesthetic potencies on an isolated frog nerve preparation at a level approximately three times that of C_D011343 . 
The racemic compound was significantly less potent than either isomer.6 . 
Both isomers of C_D011433 were capable of preventing C_D004837-induced D_D001145 in cats anaesthetized with C_D006221 , but the mean dose of ( - ) -C_D011433 was 0.09+/-0.02 mg/kg whereas that of ( + ) -C_D011433 was 4.2+/-1.2 mg/kg . 
At the effective dose level of ( + ) -C_D011433 there was a significant prolongation of the PR interval of the electrocardiogram . 
Blockade of D_D001145 with both isomers was surmountable by increasing the dose of C_D004837.7 . 
Both isomers of C_D011433 were also capable of reversing D_D017180 caused by C_D010042 in anaesthetized cats and dogs . 
The dose of ( - ) -C_D011433 was significantly smaller than that of ( + ) -C_D011433 in both species but much higher than that required to produce evidence of beta-blockade.8 . 
The implications of these results are discussed .

title : C_D019772 in combination with radiotherapy in unresectable D_D005909 : a phase 2 study . 
abstract : Improving D_D005909 multiforme ( D_D005909 ) treatment with radio-chemotherapy remains a challenge . 
C_D019772 is an attractive option as it exhibits growth inhibition of human D_D005910 as well as brain penetration . 
The present study assessed the combination of radiotherapy ( 60 Gy/30 fractions/40 days ) and C_D019772 ( 0.9 mg/m ( 2 ) /day on days 1-5 on weeks 1 , 3 and 5 ) in 50 adults with histologically proven and untreated D_D005909 . 
The incidence of non-hematological D_D064420 was low and grade 3-4 hematological D_D064420 were reported in 20 patients ( mainly D_D008231 and D_D009503 ) . 
Partial response and stabilization rates were 2 % and 32 % , respectively , with an overall time to progression of 12 weeks . 
One-year overall survival ( OS ) rate was 42 % , with a median OS of 40 weeks . 
C_D019772 in combination with radiotherapy was well tolerated . 
However , while response and stabilization concerned one-third of the patients , the study did not show increased benefits in terms of survival in patients with unresectable D_D005909 .

title : Long-term C_D008094 therapy leading to D_D006961 : a case report . 
abstract : PURPOSE : This paper reviews the effect of chronic C_D008094 therapy on serum C_D002118 level and parathyroid glands , its pathogenesis , and treatment options . 
We examined the case of a C_D008094-treated patient who had recurrent D_D006934 to better understand the disease process . 
CONCLUSION : Primary D_D006961 is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect of long-term C_D008094 therapy . 
Careful patient selection and long-term follow-up can reduce morbidity . 
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS : As much as 15 % of C_D008094-treated patients become D_D006934 . 
By routinely monitoring serum C_D002118 levels , healthcare providers can improve the quality of life of this patient group .

title : Comparison of laryngeal mask with endotracheal tube for anesthesia in endoscopic sinus surgery . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : The purpose of this study was to compare surgical conditions , including the amount of intraoperative D_D006470 as well as intraoperative blood pressure , during functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS ) using flexible reinforced laryngeal mask airway ( FRLMA ) versus endotracheal tube ( ETT ) in maintaining controlled D_D007022 anesthesia induced by C_D015742-C_C071741 total i.v . 
anesthesia ( TIVA ) . 
METHODS : Sixty normotensive American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II adult patients undergoing FESS under controlled D_D007022 anesthesia caused by C_D015742-C_C071741-TIVA were randomly assigned into two groups : group I , FRLMA ; group II , ETT . 
D_D006470 was measured and the visibility of the operative field was evaluated according to a six-point scale . 
RESULTS : Controlled D_D007022 was achieved within a shorter period using laryngeal mask using lower rates of C_C071741 infusion and lower total dose of C_C071741 . 
CONCLUSION : In summary , our results indicate that airway management using FRLMA during controlled D_D007022 anesthesia provided better surgical conditions in terms of quality of operative field and blood loss and allowed for convenient induced D_D007022 with low doses of C_C071741 during TIVA in patients undergoing FESS .

title : D_D065626 during C_D014635 therapy . 
abstract : C_D014635 ( C_D014635 ) is effective for the treatment of many types of D_D004827 , but its use can be associated with an increase in body weight . 
We report a case of D_D065626 ( D_D065626 ) arising in a child who developed D_D009765 during C_D014635 treatment . 
Laboratory data revealed D_D006946 with D_D007333 . 
After the withdrawal of C_D014635 therapy , our patient showed a significant D_D015431 , a decrease of body mass index , and normalization of metabolic and endocrine parameters ; moreover , ultrasound measurements showed a complete normalization . 
The present case suggests that D_D009765 , D_D006946 , D_D007333 , and long-term treatment with C_D014635 may be all associated with the development of D_D065626 ; this side effect is reversible after C_D014635 withdrawal .

abstract : C_D013956 , like C_D002231 and C_D011441 ( C_D011441 ) are commonly prescribed for the treatment of D_D006980 . 
One should be aware of the side effects of C_D013956 . 
D_D056648 is a potentially life-threatening adverse effect of C_D013956 . 
We report a patient with D_D006111 who developed ANCA positive C_D002231 induced D_D014657 . 
The episode was characterized by a D_D014657 D_D005076 associated with large joint D_D001168 , D_D005334 and D_D010309 but no renal or pulmonary involvement . 
He was referred to us for neurological evaluation because he had difficulty in getting up from squatting position and was suspected to have D_D009220 . 
C_D002231 and C_D008713 have a lower incidence of reported ANCA positive side effects than PUT . 
To the best of our knowledge this is the first ANCA positive C_D002231 induced D_D014657 case reported from India .

title : C_D001241 for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events : an update of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : D_D003327 and D_D002561 are leading causes of death in the United States . 
In 2002 , the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) strongly recommended that clinicians discuss C_D001241 with adults who are at increased risk for D_D003327 . 
PURPOSE : To determine the benefits and harms of taking C_D001241 for the primary prevention of D_D009203 , D_D020521 , and death . 
DATA SOURCES : MEDLINE and Cochrane Library ( search dates , 1 January 2001 to 28 August 2008 ) , recent systematic reviews , reference lists of retrieved articles , and suggestions from experts . 
STUDY SELECTION : English-language randomized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) ; case-control studies ; meta-analyses ; and systematic reviews of C_D001241 versus control for the primary prevention of D_D002318 ( D_D002318 ) were selected to answer the following questions : Does C_D001241 decrease coronary heart events , D_D020521 , death from coronary heart events or D_D020521 , or all-cause mortality in adults without known D_D002318 ? 
Does C_D001241 increase D_D006471 or hemorrhagic D_D020521 ? 
DATA EXTRACTION : All studies were reviewed , abstracted , and rated for quality by using predefined USPSTF criteria . 
DATA SYNTHESIS : New evidence from 1 good-quality RCT , 1 good-quality meta-analysis , and 2 fair-quality subanalyses of RCTs demonstrates that C_D001241 use reduces the number of D_D002318 events in patients without known D_D002318 . 
Men in these studies experienced fewer D_D009203 and women experienced fewer ischemic D_D020521 . 
C_D001241 does not seem to affect D_D002318 mortality or all-cause mortality in either men or women . 
The use of C_D001241 for primary prevention increases the risk for major D_D006470 events , primarily D_D006471 events , in both men and women . 
Men have an increased risk for hemorrhagic D_D020521 with C_D001241 use . 
A new RCT and meta-analysis suggest that the risk for hemorrhagic D_D020521 in women is not statistically significantly increased . 
LIMITATIONS : New evidence on C_D001241 for the primary prevention of D_D002318 is limited . 
The dose of C_D001241 used in the RCTs varied , which prevented the estimation of the most appropriate dose for primary prevention . 
Several of the RCTs were conducted within populations of health professionals , which potentially limits generalizability . 
CONCLUSION : C_D001241 reduces the risk for D_D009203 in men and D_D020521 in women . 
C_D001241 use increases the risk for serious D_D006470 events .

title : Reducing harm associated with anticoagulation : practical considerations of C_C031942 therapy in C_D006493-induced D_D013921 . 
abstract : C_C031942 is a hepatically metabolized , direct thrombin inhibitor used for prophylaxis or treatment of D_D013927 in C_D006493-induced D_D013921 ( D_D013921 ) and for patients with or at risk of D_D013921 undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . 
The objective of this review is to summarize practical considerations of C_C031942 therapy in D_D013921 . 
The US FDA-recommended C_C031942 dose in D_D013921 is 2 microg/kg/min ( reduced in patients with D_D008107 and in paediatric patients ) , adjusted to achieve activated partial thromboplastin times ( aPTTs ) 1.5-3 times baseline ( not > 100 seconds ) . 
Contemporary experiences indicate that reduced doses are also needed in patients with conditions associated with hepatic hypoperfusion , e.g . 
D_D006333 , yet are unnecessary for D_D007674 , adult age , sex , race/ethnicity or D_D009765 . 
C_C031942 0.5-1.2 microg/kg/min typically supports therapeutic aPTTs . 
The FDA-recommended dose during PCI is 25 microg/kg/min ( 350 microg/kg initial bolus ) , adjusted to achieve activated clotting times ( ACTs ) of 300-450 sec . 
For PCI , C_C031942 has not been investigated in hepatically impaired patients ; dose adjustment is unnecessary for adult age , sex , race/ethnicity or D_D009765 , and lesser doses may be adequate with concurrent glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition . 
C_C031942 prolongs the International Normalized Ratio , and published approaches for monitoring the C_C031942-to-C_D014859 transition should be followed . 
Major D_D006470 with C_C031942 is 0-10 % in the non-interventional setting and 0-5.8 % periprocedurally . 
C_C031942 has no specific antidote , and if excessive anticoagulation occurs , C_C031942 infusion should be stopped or reduced . 
Improved familiarity of healthcare professionals with C_C031942 therapy in D_D013921 , including in special populations and during PCI , may facilitate reduction of harm associated with D_D013921 ( e.g . 
fewer thromboses ) or its treatment ( e.g . 
fewer C_C031942 medication errors ) .

title : D_D012206 and brain D_D002544 in a C_D003932-dependent male under C_D008691 maintenance therapy . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : There are several complications associated with C_D003932 abuse , some of which are life-threatening . 
C_D008691 may aggravate this problem . 
METHOD : A clinical case description . 
RESULTS : A 33-year-old man presented with D_D012206 and cerebral D_D002544 after intravenous C_D003932 . 
He had used C_D003932 since age 20 , and had used 150 mg C_D008691 daily for 6 months . 
He was found D_D014474 at home and was sent to our hospital . 
In the ER , his opiate level was 4497 ng/ml . 
In the ICU , we found D_D012206 , D_D058186 and acute D_D012131 . 
After transfer to an internal ward , we noted D_D001037 and D_D018908 of his left limbs . 
After MRI , we found D_D002544 . 
CONCLUSION : Those using C_D008691 and C_D003932 simultaneously may increase risk of D_D012206 and D_D002544 . 
Patients under C_D008691 maintenance therapy should be warned regarding these serious adverse events . 
Hypotheses of C_D003932-related D_D012206 and D_D020521 in C_D003932 abusers are discussed .

title : Increased vulnerability to C_D016627 lesion and reduced development of D_D004409 in mice lacking CB1 cannabinoid receptors . 
abstract : Motor impairment , C_D004298 ( C_D004298 ) neuronal activity and C_C029992 ( C_C029992 ) gene expression in the caudate-putamen ( CPu ) were measured in 6-OHC_D004298-lesioned and treated ( C_C005177 ) CB1 KO and WT mice . 
A lesion induced by 6-OHC_D004298 produced more severe motor deterioration in CB1 KO mice accompanied by more loss of C_D004298 neurons and increased C_C029992 gene expression in the CPu . 
Oxidative/nitrosative and neuroinflammatory parameters were estimated in the CPu and cingulate cortex ( Cg ) . 
CB1 KO mice exhibited higher MC_D004298 levels and iNOS protein expression in the CPu and Cg compared to WT mice . 
Treatment with C_C005177 ( 12 weeks ) resulted in less severe D_D004409 in CB1 KO than in WT mice . 
The results revealed that the lack of cannabinoid CB1 receptors increased the severity of motor impairment and C_D004298 lesion , and reduced C_D007980-induced D_D004409 . 
These results suggest that activation of CB1 receptors offers neuroprotection against C_D004298rgic lesion and the development of C_D007980-induced D_D004409 .

title : Animal model of D_D001714 induced by C_D010042 : Evidence of oxidative stress in submitochondrial particles of the rat brain . 
abstract : The intracerebroventricular ( ICV ) administration of C_D010042 ( a C_D012964 ( + ) /C_D011188 ( + ) -ATPase inhibitor ) in rats has been suggested to mimic some symptoms of human bipolar D_D001714 . 
Clinical studies have shown that D_D001714 may be related to D_D028361 . 
Herein , we investigated the behavioral and biochemical effects induced by the ICV administration of C_D010042 in rats . 
To achieve this aim , the effects of C_D010042 injection immediately after and 7 days following a single ICV administration ( at concentrations of 10 ( -2 ) and 10 ( -3 ) M ) on locomotion was measured using the open-field test . 
Additionally , C_C029684 reactive substances ( TBARSs ) and C_D013481 production were measured in submitochondrial particles of the prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , striatum and amygdala . 
Our findings demonstrated that C_D010042 at 10 ( -2 ) and 10 ( -3 ) M induced D_D009069 in rats , and this response remained up to 7 days following a single ICV injection . 
In addition , we observed that the persistent increase in the rat spontaneous locomotion is associated with increased TBARS levels and C_D013481 generation in submitochondrial particles in the prefrontal cortex , striatum and amygdala . 
In conclusion , C_D010042-induced D_D001714-like behavior may provide a useful animal model to test the hypothesis of the involvement of oxidative stress in D_D001714 .

title : Intraoperative dialysis during liver transplantation with C_D019343 dialysate . 
abstract : Liver transplantation for acutely ill patients with D_D017114 carries high intraoperative and immediate postoperative risks . 
These are increased with the presence of concomitant D_D058186 ( D_D058186 ) and intraoperative dialysis is sometimes required to allow the transplant to proceed . 
The derangements in the procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways during D_D017114 can lead to difficulties with anticoagulation during dialysis , especially when continued in the operating room . 
Systemic anticoagulation is unsafe and regional C_D019343 anticoagulation in the absence of a functional liver carries the risk of C_D019343 D_D064420 . 
C_D019343 dialysate , a new dialysate with C_D019343 can be used for anticoagulation in patients who can not tolerate C_D006493 or regional C_D019343 . 
We report a case of a 40-year-old female with C_D000082-induced D_D017114 with associated D_D058186 who underwent intraoperative dialytic support during liver transplantation anticoagulated with C_D019343 dialysate during the entire procedure . 
The patient tolerated the procedure well without any signs of C_D019343 D_D064420 and maintained adequate anticoagulation for patency of the dialysis circuit . 
C_D019343 dialysate is a safe alternative for intradialytic support of liver transplantation in D_D017114 .

title : D_D003693 in a patient with toxic C_D005424 plasma concentrations : the role of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with C_D017374 . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : To describe a case of C_D005424-induced D_D003693 associated with a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with C_D017374 . 
CASE SUMMARY : A 69-year-old white female presented to the emergency department with a history of D_D003221 and D_D010259 over the past several days . 
On admission the patient was taking C_C043211 12 mg twice daily , C_D014859 2 mg/day , C_D005492 1 mg/day , C_D013974 100 microg/day , C_C064276 40 mg/day , C_D017374 40 mg/day , and C_D005424 100 mg twice daily . 
C_D005424 had been started 2 weeks prior for D_D001281 . 
Laboratory test findings on admission were notable only for a C_D005424 plasma concentration of 1360 microg/L ( reference range 200-1000 ) . 
A metabolic drug interaction between C_D005424 and C_D017374 , which the patient had been taking for more than 5 years , was considered . 
C_D017374 was discontinued and the dose of C_D005424 was reduced to 50 mg twice daily . 
Her D_D003693 resolved 3 days later . 
DISCUSSION : C_D005424 and pharmacologically similar agents that interact with C_D012964 channels may cause D_D003693 in susceptible patients . 
A MEDLINE search ( 1966-January 2009 ) revealed one in vivo pharmacokinetic study on the interaction between C_D005424 , a CYP2D6 substrate , and C_D017374 , a CYP2D6 inhibitor , as well as 3 case reports of C_D005424-induced D_D003693 . 
According to the Naranjo probability scale , C_D005424 was the probable cause of the patient 's D_D003693 ; the Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale indicates a possible pharmacokinetic drug interaction between C_D005424 and C_D017374 . 
CONCLUSIONS : Supratherapeutic C_D005424 plasma concentrations may cause D_D003693 . 
Because D_D064420 may occur when C_D005424 is prescribed with C_D017374 and other potent CYP2D6 inhibitors , C_D005424 plasma concentrations should be monitored closely with commencement of CYP2D6 inhibitors .

title : Efficacy of C_C107135 ( C_C107135 ) in patients with advanced D_D002289 previously treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy and EGFR inhibitors . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Treatment options are scarce in pretreated advanced D_D002289 ( D_D002289 ) patients . 
C_C107135 , an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of C_D020123 ( mTOR ) , has shown phase I efficacy in D_D002289 . 
METHODS : Stage IIIb or IV D_D002289 patients , with two or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens , one C_D010984 based ( stratum 1 ) or both chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor C_D014443 kinase inhibitors ( stratum 2 ) , received C_C107135 10 mg/day until progression or unacceptable D_D064420 . 
Primary objective was overall response rate ( ORR ) . 
Analyses of markers associated with the mTOR pathway were carried out on archival D_D009369 from a subgroup using immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) and direct mutation sequencing . 
RESULTS : Eighty-five patients were enrolled , 42 in stratum 1 and 43 in stratum . 
ORR was 4.7 % ( 7.1 % stratum 1 ; 2.3 % stratum 2 ) . 
Overall disease control rate was 47.1 % . 
Median progression-free survivals ( PFSs ) were 2.6 ( stratum 1 ) and 2.7 months ( stratum 2 ) . 
Common > or =grade 3 events were D_D005221 , D_D004417 , D_D013280 , D_D000740 , and D_D013921 . 
D_D011014 , probably or possibly related , mainly grade 1/2 , occurred in 25 % . 
Cox regression analysis of IHC scores found that only phospho AKT ( pAKT ) was a significant independent predictor of worse PFS . 
CONCLUSIONS : C_C107135 10 mg/day was well tolerated , showing modest clinical activity in pretreated D_D002289 . 
Evaluation of C_C107135 plus standard therapy for metastatic D_D002289 continues .

title : Posttransplant D_D000740 : the role of C_D020123 . 
abstract : Posttransplant D_D000740 is a common problem that may hinder patients ' quality of life . 
It occurs in 12 to 76 % of patients , and is most common in the immediate posttransplant period . 
A variety of factors have been identified that increase the risk of posttransplant D_D000740 , of which the level of renal function is most important . 
C_D020123 , a mammalian target of C_D020123 inhibitor , has been implicated as playing a special role in posttransplant D_D000740 . 
This review considers D_D000740 associated with C_D020123 , including its presentation , mechanisms , and management .

title : Coronary computerized tomography angiography for rapid discharge of low-risk patients with C_D003042-associated D_D002637 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Most patients presenting to emergency departments ( EDs ) with C_D003042-associated D_D002637 are admitted for at least 12 hours and receive a `` rule out D_D054058 '' protocol , often with noninvasive testing prior to discharge . 
In patients without C_D003042 use , coronary computerized tomography angiography ( CTA ) has been shown to be useful for identifying a group of patients at low risk for cardiac events who can be safely discharged . 
It is unclear whether a coronary CTA strategy would be efficacious in C_D003042-associated D_D002637 , as D_D003329 may account for some of the D_D007511 . 
We studied whether a negative coronary CTA in patients with C_D003042-associated D_D002637 could identify a subset safe for discharge . 
METHODS : We prospectively evaluated the safety of coronary CTA for low-risk patients who presented to the ED with C_D003042associated D_D002637 ( self-reported or positive urine test ) . 
Consecutive patients received either immediate coronary CTA in the ED ( without serial markers ) or underwent coronary CTA after a brief observation period with serial cardiac marker measurements . 
Patients with negative coronary CTA ( maximal D_D003251 less than 50 % ) were discharged . 
The main outcome was 30-day cardiovascular death or D_D009203 . 
RESULTS : A total of 59 patients with C_D003042-associated D_D002637 were evaluated . 
Patients had a mean age of 45.6 +/- 6.6 yrs and were 86 % black , 66 % male . 
Seventy-nine percent had a normal or nonspecific ECG and 85 % had a TIMI score < 2 . 
Twenty patients received coronary CTA immediately in the ED , 18 of whom were discharged following CTA ( 90 % ) . 
Thirty-nine received coronary CTA after a brief observation period , with 37 discharged home following CTA ( 95 % ) . 
Six patients had coronary D_D003251 > or=50 % . 
During the 30-day follow-up period , no patients died of a cardiovascular event ( 0 % ; 95 % CI , 0-6.1 % ) and no patient sustained a nonfatal D_D009203 ( 0 % ; 95 % CI , 0-6.1 % ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : Although C_D003042-associated myocardial D_D007511 can result from coronary vasoconstriction , patients with C_D003042 associated D_D002637 , a non-D_D007511 ECG , and a TIMI risk score < 2 may be safely discharged from the ED after a negative coronary CTA with a low risk of 30-day adverse events .

title : Late fulminant D_D054038 after liver transplant . 
abstract : OBJECTIVES : D_D054038 due to calcineurin-inhibitor-related D_D020258 is a rare but severe complication that results from treatment with immunosuppressive agents ( primarily those administered after a liver or kidney transplant ) . 
The pathophysiologic mechanisms of that disorder remain unknown . 
CASE : We report the case of a 46-year-old woman who received a liver transplant in our center as treatment for D_D008104 and in whom either a fulminant course of D_D054038 or D_D054038 developed 110 days after transplant . 
After an initially uneventful course after the transplant , the patient rapidly fell into deep coma . 
RESULTS : Cerebral MRI scan showed typical signs of enhancement in the pontine and posterior regions . 
Switching the immunosuppressive regimen from C_D016559 to C_D016572 did not improve the clinical situation . 
The termination of treatment with any calcineurin inhibitor resulted in a complete resolution of that complication . 
CONCLUSIONS : D_D054038 after liver transplant is rare . 
We recommend a complete cessation of any calcineurin inhibitor rather than a dose reduction .

title : Prolonged D_D007035 as a bridge to recovery for D_D001929 and D_D019586 associated with D_D017114 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : To review evidence-based treatment options in patients with D_D001929 complicating D_D017114 ( D_D017114 ) and discuss the potential applications of D_D007035 . 
METHOD : Case-based observations from a medical intensive care unit ( MICU ) in a tertiary care facility in a 27-year-old female with D_D017114 from C_D000082 and resultant D_D001929 . 
RESULTS : Our patient was admitted to the MICU after being found unresponsive with presumed D_D064420 from C_D000082 which was ingested over a 2-day period . 
The patient had depressed of mental status lasting at least 24 h prior to admission . 
Initial evaluation confirmed D_D017114 from C_D000082 and D_D001929 . 
The patient was treated with hyperosmolar therapy , D_D006985 , sedation , and chemical D_D010243 . 
Her intracranial pressure remained elevated despite maximal medical therapy . 
We then initiated therapeutic D_D007035 which was continued for 5 days . 
At re-warming , patient had resolution of her D_D001929 and D_D019586 . 
At discharge , she had complete recovery of neurological and hepatic functions . 
CONCLUSION : In patients with D_D017114 and D_D001929 from C_D000082 D_D062787 , prolonged therapeutic D_D007035 could potentially be used as a life saving therapy and a bridge to hepatic and neurological recovery . 
A clinical trial of D_D007035 in patients with this condition is warranted .

abstract : This study investigated the D_D014786 associated with the antiepileptic drug C_D020888 ( C_D020888 ) . 
Two hundred four people with D_D004827 were grouped on the basis of antiepileptic drug therapy ( current , previous , or no exposure to C_D020888 ) . 
Groups were matched with respect to age , gender , and D_D012640 frequency . 
All patients underwent objective assessment of electrophysiological function ( wide-field multifocal electroretinography ) and conventional visual field testing ( static perimetry ) . 
Bilateral visual field constriction was observed in 59 % of patients currently taking C_D020888 , 43 % of patients who previously took C_D020888 , and 24 % of patients with no exposure to C_D020888 . 
Assessment of retinal function revealed abnormal responses in 48 % of current C_D020888 users and 22 % of prior C_D020888 users , but in none of the patients without previous exposure to C_D020888 . 
D_D014786 are common in the treated D_D004827 population , irrespective of drug history . 
Assessment by conventional static perimetry may neither be sufficiently sensitive nor specific to reliably identify D_D012164 associated with C_D020888 .

title : Smoking of C_D016578 as a risk factor for D_D015658 among people who use injection drugs . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : Little is known about the possible role that smoking C_D016578 has on the incidence of D_D015658 . 
Given the increasing use of C_D016578 , we sought to examine whether use of this illicit drug has become a risk factor for D_D015658 . 
METHODS : We included data from people participating in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study who reported injecting illicit drugs at least once in the month before enrolment , lived in the greater Vancouver area , were HIV-negative at enrolment and completed at least 1 follow-up study visit . 
To determine whether the risk of D_D006679 among daily smokers of C_D016578 changed over time , we used Cox proportional hazards regression and divided the study into 3 periods : May 1 , 1996-Nov. 30 , 1999 ( period 1 ) , Dec. 1 , 1999-Nov. 30 , 2002 ( period 2 ) , and Dec. 1 , 2002-Dec. 30 , 2005 ( period 3 ) . 
RESULTS : Overall , 1048 eligible injection drug users were included in our study . 
Of these , 137 acquired D_D015658 during follow-up . 
The mean proportion of participants who reported daily smoking of C_D016578 increased from 11.6 % in period 1 to 39.7 % in period 3 . 
After adjusting for potential confounders , we found that the risk of D_D006679 among participants who were daily smokers of C_D016578 increased over time ( period 1 : hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.03 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.57-1.85 ; period 2 : HR 1.68 , 95 % CI 1.01-2.80 ; and period 3 : HR 2.74 , 95 % CI 1.06-7.11 ) . 
INTERPRETATION : Smoking of C_D016578 was found to be an independent risk factor for D_D006679 among people who were injection drug users . 
This finding points to the urgent need for evidence-based public health initiatives targeted at people who smoke C_D016578 .

title : C_D005473 improves the D_D008569 caused by the chemotherapy agent C_D005472 . 
abstract : D_D009369 patients who have been treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy have described experiencing deteriorations in cognition . 
A widely used chemotherapeutic agent , C_D005472 ( C_D005472 ) , readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and so could have a direct effect on brain function . 
In particular this anti mitotic drug could reduce cell proliferation in the neurogenic regions of the adult brain . 
In contrast reports indicate that hippocampal dependent neurogenesis and cognition are enhanced by the C_D017367 antidepressant C_D005473 . 
In this investigation the behavioural effects of chronic ( two week ) treatment with C_D005472 and ( three weeks ) with C_D005473 either separately or in combination with C_D005472 were tested on adult Lister hooded rats . 
Behavioural effects were tested using a context dependent conditioned emotional response test ( CER ) which showed that animals treated with C_D005472 had a significant reduction in freezing time compared to controls . 
A separate group of animals was tested using a hippocampal dependent spatial working memory test , the object location recognition test ( OLR ) . 
Animals treated only with C_D005472 showed significant deficits in their ability to carry out the OLR task but co administration of C_D005473 improved their performance . 
C_D005472 chemotherapy caused a significant reduction in the number of proliferating cells in the sub granular zone of the dentate gyrus compared to controls . 
This reduction was eliminated when C_D005473 was co administered with C_D005472 . 
C_D005473 on its own had no effect on proliferating cell number or behaviour . 
These findings suggest that C_D005472 can negatively affect both cell proliferation and hippocampal dependent working memory and that these deficits can be reversed by the simultaneous administration of the antidepressant C_D005473 .

title : Liver-specific ablation of integrin-linked kinase in mice results in enhanced and prolonged cell proliferation and D_D006529 after C_D010634 administration . 
abstract : We have recently demonstrated that disruption of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) /integrin signaling via elimination of integrin-linked kinase ( ILK ) in hepatocytes interferes with signals leading to termination of liver regeneration . 
This study investigates the role of ILK in liver enlargement induced by C_D010634 ( C_D010634 ) . 
Wild-type ( WT ) and ILK : liver-/- mice were given C_D010634 ( 0.1 % in drinking water ) for 10 days . 
Livers were harvested on 2 , 5 , and 10 days during C_D010634 administration . 
In the hepatocyte-specific ILK/liver-/- mice , the liver : body weight ratio was more than double as compared to 0 h at day 2 ( 2.5 times ) , while at days 5 and 10 , it was enlarged three times . 
In the WT mice , the increase was as expected from previous literature ( 1.8 times ) and seems to have leveled off after day 2 . 
There were slightly increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells in the ILK/liver-/- animals at day 2 as compared to WT after C_D010634 administration . 
In the WT animals , the proliferative response had come back to normal by days 5 and 10 . 
Hepatocytes of the ILK/liver-/- mice continued to proliferate up until day 10 . 
ILK/liver-/- mice also showed increased expression of key genes involved in hepatocyte proliferation at different time points during C_D010634 administration . 
In summary , ECM proteins communicate with the signaling machinery of dividing cells via ILK to regulate hepatocyte proliferation and termination of the proliferative response . 
Lack of ILK in the hepatocytes imparts prolonged proliferative response not only to stimuli related to liver regeneration but also to xenobiotic chemical mitogens , such as C_D010634 .

title : Decreased Expression of C_D012964/C_D011188-ATPase , NHE3 , NBC1 , AQP1 and OAT in C_D005839-induced D_D007674 . 
abstract : The present study was aimed to determine whether there is an altered regulation of tubular transporters in C_D005839-induced D_D007674 . 
Sprague-Dawley male rats ( 200~250 g ) were subcutaneously injected with C_D005839 ( 100 mg/kg per day ) for 7 days , and the expression of tubular transporters was determined by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry . 
The mRNA and protein expression of OAT was also determined . 
C_D005839-treated rats exhibited significantly decreased C_D003404 clearance along with increased plasma C_D003404 levels . 
Accordingly , the fractional excretion of C_D012964 increased . 
Urine volume was increased , while urine osmolality and free water reabsorption were decreased . 
Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry revealed decreased expression of C_D012964 ( + ) /C_D011188 ( + ) -ATPase , NHE3 , NBC1 , and AQP1 in the kidney of C_D005839-treated rats . 
The expression of OAT1 and OAT3 was also decreased . 
C_D005839-induced D_D007674 may at least in part be causally related with a decreased expression of C_D012964 ( + ) /C_D011188 ( + ) -ATPase , NHE3 , NBC1 , AQP1 and OAT .

title : Longitudinal association of C_D000431 use with D_D015658 progression and psychological health of women with HIV . 
abstract : We evaluated the association of C_D000431 consumption and D_D003866 , and their effects on D_D015658 progression among women with HIV . 
The study included 871 women with HIV who were recruited from 1993-1995 in four US cities . 
The participants had physical examination , medical record extraction , and venipuncture , CD4+T-cell counts determination , measurement of D_D003866 symptoms ( using the self-report Center for Epidemiological Studies-D_D003866 Scale ) , and C_D000431 use assessment at enrollment , and semiannually until March 2000 . 
Multilevel random coefficient ordinal models as well as multilevel models with joint responses were used in the analysis . 
There was no significant association between level of C_D000431 use and CD4+ T-cell counts . 
When participants were stratified by antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) use , the association between C_D000431 and CD4+ T-cell did not reach statistical significance . 
The association between C_D000431 consumption and D_D003866 was significant ( p < 0.001 ) . 
D_D003866 had a significant negative effect on CD4+ T-cell counts over time regardless of ART use . 
Our findings suggest that C_D000431 consumption has a direct association with D_D003866 . 
Moreover , D_D003866 is associated with D_D015658 progression . 
Our findings have implications for the provision of C_D000431 use interventions and psychological resources to improve the health of women with HIV .

title : Chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 are increased in the hippocampus following C_D010862-induced D_D013226 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : D_D007249 occurs after D_D012640 and is implicated in epileptogenesis . 
CCR2 is a chemokine receptor for CCL2 and their interaction mediates monocyte infiltration in the D_D007249 cascade triggered in different brain pathologies . 
In this work CCR2 and CCL2 expression were examined following D_D013226 ( D_D013226 ) induced by C_D010862 injection . 
METHODS : D_D013226 was induced by C_D010862 injection . 
Control rats were injected with saline instead of C_D010862 . 
Five days after D_D013226 , CCR2 staining in neurons and glial cells was examined using imunohistochemical analyses . 
The number of CCR2 positive cells was determined using stereology probes in the hippocampus . 
CCL2 expression in the hippocampus was examined by molecular assay . 
RESULTS : Increased CCR2 was observed in the hippocampus after D_D013226 . 
D_D012640 also resulted in alterations to the cell types expressing CCR2 . 
Increased numbers of neurons that expressed CCR2 was observed following D_D013226 . 
Microglial cells were more closely apposed to the CCR2-labeled cells in D_D013226 rats . 
In addition , rats that experienced D_D013226 exhibited CCR2-labeling in populations of D_D006984 astrocytes , especially in CA1 and dentate gyrus . 
These CCR2+ astroctytes were not observed in control rats . 
Examination of CCL2 expression showed that it was elevated in the hippocampus following D_D013226 . 
CONCLUSION : The data show that CCR2 and CCL2 are up-regulated in the hippocampus after C_D010862-induced D_D013226 . 
D_D012640 also result in changes to CCR2 receptor expression in neurons and astrocytes . 
These changes might be involved in detrimental neuroplasticity and D_D007249 changes that occur following D_D012640 .

title : C_D008668 induction reduces caspase-3 activity and TNFalpha levels with preservation of cognitive function and intact hippocampal neurons in C_D002330-treated rats . 
abstract : Hippocampal integrity is essential for cognitive functions . 
On the other hand , induction of C_D008668 ( C_D008668 ) by C_D019287 and its role in neuroprotection has been documented . 
The present study aimed to explore the effect of C_D008668 induction on C_D002330 ( C_D002330 ) -induced hippocampal D_D003072 in rats . 
A total of 60 male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups ( 15/group ) : The control group injected with single doses of normal saline ( i.c.v ) followed 24 h later by C_D002330 solvent ( i.v ) . 
The second group administered C_D019287 ( 0.1 micromol/10 microl normal saline , i.c.v , once ) then C_D002330 solvent ( i.v ) after 24 h. Third group received C_D002330 ( 20 mg/kg , i.v , once ) 24 h after injection with normal saline ( i.c.v ) . 
Fourth group received a single dose of C_D019287 ( 0.1 micromol/10 microl normal saline , i.c.v ) then C_D002330 ( 20 mg/kg , i.v , once ) after 24 h. The obtained data revealed that C_D002330 administration resulted in deterioration of learning and short-term memory ( STM ) , as measured by using radial arm water maze , accompanied with decreased hippocampal C_D005978 reductase ( GR ) activity and reduced C_D005978 ( C_D005978 ) content . 
Also , C_D002330 administration increased serum D_D009369 D_D009336 factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) , hippocampal C_D008668 and C_D008315 ( C_D008315 ) contents as well as caspase-3 activity in addition to histological alterations . 
C_D019287 pretreatment counteracted C_D002330-induced inhibition of GR and depletion of C_D005978 and resulted in significant reduction in the levels of C_D008315 and TNFalpha as well as the activity of caspase-3 . 
The histological features were improved in hippocampus of rats treated with C_D019287 + C_D002330 compared to only C_D002330-treated animals . 
In conclusion , C_D008668 induction halts C_D002330-induced hippocampal D_D064420 as it prevented GR inhibition and C_D005978 depletion and counteracted the increased levels of TNFalpha , C_D008315 and caspase-3 activity with subsequent preservation of cognition .

abstract : The most severe adverse reactions to C_D002220 have been observed in the haemopoietic system , the liver and the cardiovascular system . 
A frequently fatal , although exceptionally rare side effect of C_D002220 is necrotizing eosinophilic ( D_D004342 ) D_D009205 . 
We report a case of D_D004342 D_D009205 secondary to administration of C_D002220 . 
Acute D_D004342 D_D009205 was not suspected clinically , and the diagnosis was made post-mortem . 
Histology revealed diffuse infiltration of the myocardium by eosinophils and lymphocytes with myocyte damage . 
Clinically , death was due to D_D012770 . 
To best of our knowledge this is the second case of fatal C_D002220 induced D_D009205 reported in English literature .

title : Neuropsychiatric behaviors in the C_D015632 marmoset model of D_D010302 . 
abstract : OBJECTIVES : Neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a significant problem in patients with D_D010302 ( D_D010302 ) . 
These symptoms may be due to 'sensitisation ' following repeated C_D007980 treatment or a direct effect of C_D004298 on the disease state . 
The C_D007980-treated C_D015632-lesioned marmoset was used as a model of D_D001523 in D_D010302 patients . 
Here we compare the time course of C_D007980-induced motor fluctuations and D_D001523 to determine the relationship between duration of treatment and onset of symptoms . 
METHODS : Marmosets were administered C_D015632 ( 2.0 mg/kg s.c. ) for five days , resulting in stable D_D010302 . 
C_D007980 ( 15 mg/kg and C_D001545 , 3.75 mg/kg ) p.o . 
b.i.d , was administered for 30 days . 
Animals were evaluated for D_D020734 , D_D004409 and on-time ( motor fluctuations ) and D_D001523 on Day 0 ( prior to C_D007980 ) and on Days 1 , 7 , 13 , 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc DVD analysis by a trained rater , blind to the treatment day . 
RESULTS : The D_D001523 rating scale demonstrated high interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional backgrounds . 
As anticipated , animals exhibited a progressive increase in C_D007980-induced motor fluctuations , D_D004409 and wearing-off , that correlated with the duration of C_D007980 therapy . 
In contrast , C_D007980-induced D_D001523 were present on Day 1 of C_D007980 treatment and their severity did not correlate with duration of treatment . 
CONCLUSIONS : The data suggest that D_D001523 in D_D010302 are more likely an interaction between C_D007980 and the disease state than a consequence of sensitisation to repeated C_D004298rgic therapy .

title : C_D003287 D_D007674 after renal artery and coronary angioplasty . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : D_D007674 induced by iodinated C_D003287 ( C_D003287 ) administration can minimize the benefit of the interventional procedure in patients undergoing renal angioplasty ( PTRA ) . 
PURPOSE : To compare the susceptibility to D_D007674 effect of C_D003287 in patients undergoing PTRA with that of patients submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . 
MATERIAL AND METHODS : A total of 33 patients successfully treated with PTRA ( PTRA group , mean age 70+/-12 years , 23 female , basal C_D003404 1.46+/-0.79 , range 0.7-4.9 mg/dl ) were compared with 33 patients undergoing successful PCI ( PCI group ) , matched for basal C_D003404 ( 1.44+/-0.6 , range 0.7-3.4 mg/dl ) , gender , and age . 
In both groups postprocedural ( 48 h ) serum C_D003404 was measured . 
RESULTS : Postprocedural C_D003404 level decreased nonsignificantly in the PTRA group ( 1.46+/-0.8 vs. 1.34+/-0.5 mg/dl , P=NS ) and increased significantly in the PCI group ( 1.44+/-0.6 vs. 1.57+/-0.7 mg/dl , P < 0.02 ) . 
Changes in serum C_D003404 after intervention ( after-before ) were significantly different between the PTRA and PCI groups ( -0.12+/-0.5 vs. 0.13+/-0.3 , P=0.014 ) . 
This difference was not related to either a different clinical risk profile or to the volume of C_D003287 administered . 
CONCLUSION : In this preliminary study patients submitted to PTRA showed a lower susceptibility to D_D007674 induced by C_D003287 administration than PCI patients . 
The effectiveness of PTRA on renal function seems to be barely influenced by C_D003287 D_D064420 .

title : Medical and psychiatric outcomes for patients transplanted for C_D000082-induced D_D017114 : a case-control study . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : C_D000082-induced D_D056486 is the most common cause of D_D017114 ( D_D017114 ) in the UK . 
Patients often consume the drug with suicidal intent or with a background of substance dependence . 
AIMS AND METHODS : We compared the severity of pretransplant illness , psychiatric co-morbidity , medical and psychosocial outcomes of all patients who had undergone liver transplantation ( LT ) emergently between 1999-2004 for C_D000082-induced D_D017114 ( n=36 ) with age- and sex-matched patients undergoing emergent LT for non-C_D000082-induced D_D017114 ( n=35 ) and elective LT for D_D008107 ( D_D008107 , n=34 ) . 
RESULTS : C_D000082-induced D_D017114 patients undergoing LT had a greater severity of pre-LT illness reflected by higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores and requirement for organ support compared with the other two groups . 
Twenty ( 56 % ) C_D000082-induced D_D017114 patients had a formal psychiatric diagnosis before LT ( non-C_D000082-induced D_D017114=0/35 , D_D008107=2/34 ; P < 0.01 for all ) and nine ( 25 % ) had a previous suicide attempt . 
During follow-up ( median 5 years ) , there were no significant differences in rejection ( acute and chronic ) , graft failure or survival between the groups ( C_D000082-induced D_D017114 1 year 87 % , 5 years 75 % ; non-C_D000082-induced D_D017114 88 % , 78 % ; D_D008107 93 % , 82 % : P > 0.6 log rank ) . 
Two C_D000082-induced D_D017114 patients reattempted suicide post-LT ( one died 8 years post-LT ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : Despite a high prevalence of psychiatric disturbance , outcomes for patients transplanted emergently for C_D000082-induced D_D017114 were comparable to those transplanted for non-C_D000082-induced D_D017114 and electively for D_D008107 . 
Multidisciplinary approaches with long-term psychiatric follow-up may contribute to low post-transplant suicide rates seen and low rates of graft loss because of non-compliance .

title : Studies of synergy between C_D009020 and a novel C_D012964 channel blocker , C_C401121 , in rat models of inflammatory and D_D009437 . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : This study determined the antihyperalgesic effect of C_C401121 , a C_D012964 channel blocker with antioxidant properties given alone and in combinations with C_D009020 in rat models of inflammatory and D_D009437 . 
DESIGN : Dose response curves for nonsedating doses of C_D009020 and C_C401121 given intraperitoneally alone and together in combinations were constructed for antihyperalgesic effect using paw withdrawal from noxious heat in two rat D_D010146 models : C_D002351-induced paw D_D007249 and C_D013311 ( C_D013311 ) -induced D_D003929 . 
RESULTS : The maximum nonsedating doses were : C_D009020 , 3.2 mg/kg ; C_C401121 10.0 mg/kg ; 5.0 mg/kg C_C401121 with C_D009020 3.2 mg/kg in combination . 
The doses calculated to cause 50 % reversal of D_D006930 ( ED50 ) were 7.54 ( 1.81 ) and 4.83 ( 1.54 ) in the C_D002351 model and 44.18 ( 1.37 ) and 9.14 ( 1.24 ) in the C_D013311-induced D_D009422 model for C_C401121 and C_D009020 , respectively ( mg/kg ; mean , SEM ) . 
These values were greater than the maximum nonsedating doses . 
The ED50 values for C_D009020 when given in combination with C_C401121 ( 5 mg/kg ) were less than the maximum nonsedating dose : 0.56 ( 1.55 ) in the C_D002351 model and 1.37 ( 1.23 ) in the D_D009422 model ( mg/kg ; mean , SEM ) . 
The antinociception after C_D009020 ( 3.2 mg/kg ) was increased by co-administration with C_C401121 from 28.0 and 31.7 % to 114.6 and 56.9 % reversal of D_D006930 in the inflammatory and D_D009422 models , respectively ( P < 0.01 ; one-way analysis of variance-significantly greater than either drug given alone ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : The maximum antihyperalgesic effect achievable with nonsedating doses of C_D009020 may be increased significantly when the drug is used in combination with C_C401121 .

title : C_D006493-induced D_D013921 : a practical review . 
abstract : C_D006493-induced D_D013921 ( D_D013921 ) remains under-recognized despite its potentially devastating outcomes . 
It begins when C_D006493 exposure stimulates the formation of C_D006493-platelet factor 4 antibodies , which in turn triggers the release of procoagulant platelet particles . 
D_D013927 and D_D013921 that follow comprise the 2 hallmark traits of D_D013921 , with the former largely responsible for significant vascular complications . 
The prevalence of D_D013921 varies among several subgroups , with greater incidence in surgical as compared with medical populations . 
D_D013921 must be acknowledged for its intense predilection for D_D013927 and suspected whenever D_D013927 occurs after C_D006493 exposure . 
Early recognition that incorporates the clinical and serologic clues is paramount to timely institution of treatment , as its delay may result in catastrophic outcomes . 
The treatment of D_D013921 mandates an immediate cessation of all C_D006493 exposure and the institution of an antithrombotic therapy , most commonly using a C_D000991 . 
Current `` diagnostic '' tests , which primarily include functional and antigenic assays , have more of a confirmatory than diagnostic role in the management of D_D013921 . 
Special attention must be paid to cardiac patients who are often exposed to C_D006493 multiple times during their course of treatment . 
C_D000991 are appropriate , evidence-based alternatives to C_D006493 in patients with a history of D_D013921 , who need to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention . 
As C_D006493 remains one of the most frequently used medications today with potential for D_D013921 with every C_D006493 exposure , a close vigilance of platelet counts must be practiced whenever C_D006493 is initiated .

title : Abductor D_D010243 after C_C542870 injection for D_D014826 . 
abstract : OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS : Botulinum toxin ( C_C542870 ) injections into the thyroarytenoid muscles are the current standard of care for D_D014826 ( D_D014826 ) . 
Reported adverse effects include a period of breathiness , D_D010612 , and difficulty with swallowing liquids . 
Here we report multiple cases of bilateral abductor D_D010243 following C_C542870 injections for D_D014826 , a complication previously unreported . 
STUDY DESIGN : Retrospective case series . 
METHODS : Patients that received C_C542870 injections for D_D055154 between January 2000 and October 2009 were evaluated . 
Patients with D_D014826 were identified . 
The number of treatments received and adverse effects were noted . 
For patients with bilateral abductor D_D010243 , age , sex , paralytic C_C542870 dose , prior C_C542870 dose , and course following D_D010243 were noted . 
RESULTS : From a database of 452 patients receiving C_C542870 , 352 patients had been diagnosed with D_D014826 . 
Of these 352 patients , eight patients suffered bilateral abductor D_D010243 , and two suffered this complication twice . 
All affected patients were females over the age of 50 years . 
Most patients had received treatments prior to abductor D_D010243 and continued receiving after D_D010243 . 
Seven patients recovered after a brief period of activity restrictions , and one underwent a tracheotomy . 
The incidence of abductor D_D010243 after C_C542870 injection for D_D014826 was 0.34 % . 
CONCLUSIONS : Bilateral abductor D_D010243 is a rare complication of C_C542870 injections for D_D014826 , causing difficulty with breathing upon exertion . 
The likely mechanism of D_D010243 is diffusion of C_C542870 around the muscular process of the arytenoid to the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles . 
The D_D010243 is temporary , and watchful waiting with restriction of activity is the recommended management .

title : D_D028361 contributes to C_D003042-induced D_D006331 : Prevention by the targeted antioxidant C_C476756 . 
abstract : The goal of this study was to assess mitochondrial function and ROS production in an experimental model of C_D003042-induced D_D006331 . 
We hypothesized that C_D003042 abuse may lead to altered mitochondrial function that in turn may cause D_D018487 . 
Seven days of C_D003042 administration to rats led to an increased C_D010100 consumption detected in cardiac fibers , specifically through complex I and complex III . 
ROS levels were increased , specifically in interfibrillar mitochondria . 
In parallel there was a decrease in C_D000255 synthesis , whereas no difference was observed in subsarcolemmal mitochondria . 
This uncoupling effect on oxidative phosphorylation was not detectable after short-term exposure to C_D003042 , suggesting that these D_D028361 were a late rather than a primary event in the pathological response to C_D003042 . 
C_C476756 , a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant , was shown to completely prevent these D_D028361 as well as D_D006331 characterized here by a D_-1 studied with a conductance catheter to obtain pressure-volume data . 
Taken together , these results extend previous studies and demonstrate that C_D003042-induced D_D006331 may be due to a D_D028361 .

Drug-induced immune D_D000743 was suspected because of positive direct antiglobulin test , negative eluate , and microspherocytes on smear pre- and post-transfusion . 
Drug studies using the indirect antiglobulin test were strongly positive with C_D014295 and C_D014295-C_D013420 but negative with C_D013420 . 
The patient recovered after discontinuing the drug , with no recurrence in 2 years . 
Other causes of D_D000740 should be considered in patients with worse-than-expected D_D000740 after chemotherapy . 
Furthermore , D_D006461 during transfusion is not always a transfusion reaction .

title : Blockade of endothelial-mesenchymal transition by a Smad3 inhibitor delays the early development of C_D013311-induced D_D003928 . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : A multicenter , controlled trial showed that early blockade of the renin-C_D000804 system in patients with D_D003922 and normoalbuminuria did not retard the progression of D_D007674 , suggesting that other mechanism ( s ) are involved in the pathogenesis of early D_D003928 ( D_D003928 ) . 
We have previously demonstrated that endothelial-mesenchymal-transition ( EndoMT ) contributes to the early development of renal interstitial D_D005355 independently of microalbuminuria in mice with C_D013311 ( C_D013311 ) -induced D_D003920 . 
In the present study , we hypothesized that blocking EndoMT reduces the early development of D_D003928 . 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : EndoMT was induced in a mouse pancreatic microvascular endothelial cell line ( MMEC ) in the presence of advanced glycation end products ( AGEs ) and in the endothelial lineage-traceble mouse line Tie2-Cre ; Loxp-EGFP by administration of AGEs , with nonglycated mouse albumin serving as a control . 
Phosphorylated Smad3 was detected by immunoprecipitation/Western blotting and confocal microscopy . 
Blocking studies using receptor for AGE siRNA and a specific inhibitor of Smad3 ( SIS3 ) were performed in MMECs and in C_D013311-induced D_D003928 in Tie2-Cre ; Loxp-EGFP mice . 
RESULTS : Confocal microscopy and real-time PCR demonstrated that AGEs induced EndoMT in MMECs and in Tie2-Cre ; Loxp-EGFP mice . 
Immunoprecipitation/Western blotting showed that Smad3 was activated by AGEs but was inhibited by SIS3 in MMECs and in C_D013311-induced D_D003928 . 
Confocal microscopy and real-time PCR further demonstrated that SIS3 abrogated EndoMT , reduced renal D_D005355 , and retarded progression of D_D007674 . 
CONCLUSIONS : EndoMT is a novel pathway leading to early development of D_D003928 . 
Blockade of EndoMT by SIS3 may provide a new strategy to retard the progression of D_D003928 and other D_D003920 complications .

title : Cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects of C_C401859 in refractory D_D020522 . 
abstract : D_D020522 ( D_D020522 ) is a rare and aggressive type of D_D008228 . 
Patients become progressively refractory to conventional chemotherapy , and their prognosis is poor . 
However , a 38 % remission rate has been recently reported in refractory D_D020522 treated with C_C401859 , a mTOR inhibitor.Here we had the opportunity to study a case of refractory D_D020522 who had D_D009369 regression two months after C_C401859 treatment , and a progression-free survival of 10 months . 
In this case , lymph node biopsies were performed before and six months after C_C401859 therapy . 
Comparison of the two biopsies showed that C_C401859 inhibited D_D009369 cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest , but did not induce any change in the number of apoptotic D_D009369 cells . 
Apart from this cytostatic effect , C_C401859 had an antiangiogenic effect with decrease of D_D009369 microvessel density and of VEGF expression . 
Moreover , numerous patchy , well-limited fibrotic areas , compatible with post-D_D009336 tissue repair , were found after 6-month C_C401859 therapy . 
Thus , C_C401859 reduced D_D009369 burden through associated cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects.This dual effect of C_C401859 on D_D009369 tissue could contribute to its recently reported efficiency in refractory D_D020522 resistant to conventional chemotherapy .

title : D_D013575 caused by D_D006947 during use of a combined therapy with the C_D000809-converting enzyme inhibitor and C_D013148 . 
abstract : A 76 year-old woman with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting and prior D_D009203 was transferred to the emergency room with D_D014474 due to marked D_D001919 caused by D_D006947 . 
The concentration of serum C_D011188 was high , and normal sinus rhythm was restored after correction of the serum C_D011188 level . 
The cause of D_D006947 was considered to be several doses of C_D013148 , an C_D000450 antagonist , in addition to the long-term intake of C_D017257 , an ACE inhibitor . 
This case is a good example of electrolyte imbalance causing acute life-threatening cardiac events . 
Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of D_D006947 , especially in elderly patients using ACE/ARB in combination with C_D011188 sparing agents and who have mild D_D007674 .

title : Diffuse skeletal D_D010146 after administration of C_D019386 . 
abstract : BACKGROUND : D_D010024 is caused by bone resorption in excess of bone formation , and C_D004164 , are used to inhibit bone resorption . 
C_D019386 , a C_-1 , is effective for both the treatment and prevention of D_D010024 in postmenopausal women . 
Side effects are relatively few and prominently gastrointestinal . 
Musculoskeletal D_D010146 may be an important side effect in these patients . 
We presented a patient admitted to our out-patient clinic with diffuse skeletal D_D010146 after three consecutive administration of C_D019386 . 
CONCLUSION : We conclude that patients with D_D010024 can report D_D010146 , and C_D004164-related D_D010146 should also be considered before ascribing this complaint to D_D010024 .

title : Cerebrospinal fluid penetration of high-dose C_D017576 in suspected Staphylococcus aureus D_D008581 . 
abstract : OBJECTIVE : To report a case of C_D008712-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( MSSA ) D_D016470 with suspected MSSA D_D008581 treated with high-dose C_D017576 assessed with concurrent serum and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) concentrations . 
CASE SUMMARY : A 54-year-old male presented to the emergency department with generalized D_D018908 and presumed health-care-associated D_D011014 shown on chest radiograph . 
Treatment was empirically initiated with C_D014640 , C_D064704 , and C_D010878/C_C043265 . 
Blood cultures revealed S. aureus susceptible to C_D010068 . 
Empiric antibiotic treatment was narrowed to C_D009254 on day 4 . 
On day 8 , the patient developed D_D058186 ( serum C_D003404 1.9 mg/dL , increased from 1.2 mg/dL the previous day and 0.8 mg/dL on admission ) . 
The patient 's Glasgow Coma Score was 3 , with normal findings shown on computed tomography scan of the head 72 hours following an episode of D_D006323 on day 10 . 
The patient experienced relapsing MSSA D_D016470 on day 9 , increasing the suspicion for a central nervous system ( CNS ) D_D007239 . 
C_D009254 was discontinued and C_D017576 9 mg/kg daily was initiated for suspected D_D008581 and was continued until the patient 's death on day 16 . 
C_D017576 serum and CSF trough concentrations were 11.21 ug/mL and 0.52 ug/mL , respectively , prior to the third dose . 
Lumbar puncture results were inconclusive and no further blood cultures were positive for MSSA . 
C_D003401 kinase levels were normal prior to C_D017576 therapy and were not reassessed . 
DISCUSSION : C_D017576 was initiated in our patient secondary to possible C_D009254-induced acute D_D009395 and relapsing D_D016470 . 
At a dose of 9 mg/kg , resultant penetration of 5 % was higher than in previous reports , more consistent with inflamed meninges . 
CONCLUSIONS : High-dose C_D017576 may be an alternative option for MSSA D_D016470 with or without a CNS source in patients who have failed or can not tolerate standard therapy . 
Further clinical evaluation in patients with confirmed D_D008581 is warranted .

title : The role of C_D009569 in D_D012640 induced by C_D001556 in rats . 
abstract : C_D001556 is an organochloride pesticide and scabicide . 
It evokes D_D012640 mainly trough the blockage of C_D005680 ( A ) receptors . 
C_D009569 ( C_D009569 ) , gaseous neurotransmitter , has contradictor role in epileptogenesis due to opposite effects of C_D001120 , precursor of C_D009569 syntheses ( C_D009569S ) , and C_D019331 ( C_D009569S inhibitor ) observed in different D_D004827 models . 
The aim of the current study was to determine the effects of C_D009569 on the behavioral and EEG characteristics of C_D001556-induced D_D004827 in male Wistar albino rats . 
The administration of C_D001120 ( 600 , 800 and 1000 mg/kg , i.p . ) 
in dose-dependent manner significantly increased D_D012640 incidence and severity and shortened latency time to first D_D012640 elicited by lower C_D001556 dose ( 4 mg/kg , i.p . ) . 
On the contrary , pretreatment with C_D019331 ( 500 , 700 and 900 mg/kg , i.p . ) 
decreased D_D012640 incidence and severity and prolonged latency time to D_D012640 following injection with a D_D012640 dose of C_D001556 ( 8 mg/kg , i.p . ) . 
EEG analyses showed increase of number and duration of ictal periods in EEG of rats receiving C_D001120 prior to C_D001556 and decrease of this number in rats pretreated with C_D019331 . 
These results support the conclusion that C_D009569 plays a role of endogenous convulsant in rat model of C_D001556 D_D012640 .

title : Long-term oral C_D005690 treatment prevents D_D003072 in male Wistar rats treated intracerebroventricularly with C_D013311 . 
abstract : Basic and clinical research has demonstrated that D_D003704 of sporadic D_D000544 ( sD_D000544 ) type is associated with dysfunction of the insulin-receptor ( IR ) system followed by decreased C_D005947 transport via C_D005947 transporter GLUT4 and decreased C_D005947 metabolism in brain cells . 
An alternative source of energy is d-C_D005690 ( the C-4-epimer of d-C_D005947 ) which is transported into the brain by insulin-independent GLUT3 transporter where it might be metabolized to C_D005947 via the Leloir pathway . 
Exclusively parenteral daily injections of C_D005690 induce D_D008569 in rodents and are used to generate animal aging model , but the effects of oral C_D005690 treatment on cognitive functions have never been tested . 
We have investigated the effects of continuous daily oral C_D005690 ( 200 mg/kg/day ) treatment on D_D003072 in C_D013311-induced ( C_D013311-icv ) rat model of sD_D000544 , tested by Morris Water Maze and Passive Avoidance test , respectively . 
One month of oral C_D005690 treatment initiated immediately after the C_D013311-icv administration , successfully prevented development of the C_D013311-icv-induced D_D003072 . 
Beneficial effect of oral C_D005690 was independent of the rat age and of the C_D005690 dose ranging from 100 to 300 mg/kg/day . 
Additionally , oral C_D005690 administration led to the appearance of C_D005690 in the blood . 
The increase of C_D005690 concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was several times lower after oral than after parenteral administration of the same C_D005690 dose . 
Oral C_D005690 exposure might have beneficial effects on learning and memory ability and could be worth investigating for improvement of D_D003072 associated with C_D005947 hypometabolism in D_D000544 .
